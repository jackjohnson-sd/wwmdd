<description of CSV formatted play by play>
The below lines describe the playersâ€™ roles in the events in the CSV formatted play by play:

For example, the item in the eventmsgtype column is the type of basketball event and the player1_name 
column is the player committing the event. 

player1_team_abbreviation is the team that player1_name is a player on.

In some cases, the player2_name column is another player associated with this event. 

player2_team_abbreviation is the team that player2_name is a player on. 

For example, with the FOUL event, player1_name is the player committing the foul and player2_name is 
the player that is being fouled against by player1_name.

For example, with the STEAL.TURNOVER event, player1_name committed the turnover and player2_name is 
credited with the steal. 

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game. 

For example, with the REBOUND event, player1_name commits the offensive or defensive rebound and
has possession of the ball. 

For example, with the 3POINT.ASSIST event, player1_name makes the shot and player2_name is credited with the assist.

For example, with the FTMAKE event, player1_name makes the free throw. 

For example, with the 3POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block. 

For example, with the 2POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block.

Other eventmsgtype are:  
2POINT, 2POINT.ASSIST, 3POINT, 3POINT.ASSIST, FTMAKE, FTMISS, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 2POINTMISS.BLOCK  
3POINTMISS.BLOCK, REBOUND, STEAL, TURNOVER, STEAL.TURNOVER, FOUL, SUB, TIMEOUT, STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, JUMPBALL

<details on SUB events>
In an NBA game, each team can have a maximum of 5 players on the court at any given time. 

Player substitution events, called SUBS, occur throughout the game to manage playing time, foul trouble, and tactical adjustments. 

A player can only enter the game for their own team, replacing a teammate who must exit the court. 

There is no limit to the number of substitutions a team can make during a game.

Coaches aim to distribute playing time effectively to maintain player performance and prevent fatigue. 

Starters typically play around 32 minutes per game, while bench players usually play 16 minutes or less. 

Players generally play in 6-8 minute stints to stay fresh and competitive.

Substitutions are also made when players are in foul trouble. 

Each player is allowed 6 personal fouls before being disqualified from the game. 

Coaches may substitute players with a high number of fouls to avoid disqualification.

Tactical substitutions are made to match up against opposing players, change the team's playing style, or adjust to game situations.

These substitutions often occur at the beginning of each quarter or during timeouts.

For the SUB events in the example play by play, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game.
