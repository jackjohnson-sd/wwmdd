COMMENT:
Too high scoring, most likely due to my prompt instructions for Claude to 
follow competitve NBA scoring. The player-team assignment is accurate 
(based on rosters before sept2021), compared to Gemini's inaccuracies seen
 in 4/19 meeting during PbP generations

PROMPT:
Generate the play-by-play of the third quarter of this game.
