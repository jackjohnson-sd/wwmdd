COMMENT:
Claude seems to have "forgotten" that a game lasts 12 minutes and
to not end at 4 minutes. This error sporadic, occuring in future pbp(s). 
This error would be easy to fine-tune/train out of it, or through specific 
prompting, but if we try to adress many issues in prompt, prompts could become
convoluted, potentially leading to new issues in PbP generations...

PROMPT:
why did you initially end the first quarter after 8 minutes?
