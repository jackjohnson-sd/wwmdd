RESULT:
I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. In an NBA game, each quarter
lasts 12 minutes, not 8 minutes. I made an error in my play-by-play by ending the
first quarter prematurely at the 4:00 mark. Thank you for bringing this to my 
attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct my mistake by providing the
play-by-play for the remaining 4 minutes of the first quarter in my second response.
