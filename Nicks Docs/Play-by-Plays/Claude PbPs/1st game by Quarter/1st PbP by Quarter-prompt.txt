COMMENT: 
Initially, Claude generated a PbP of the first quarter that ended with 4 
minutes still on the clock. It doesn't seem to be an output 
limitation, because Claude wrote "end of first qarter" at the 4 minute mark.
(vs. Gemini, which failed to generate a complete quarter due to it's output limit 
(abt 500 words))

PROMPT: 
Create a game play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game. 
Include the lineups, all scoring events, fouls, player substitutions,
free throws, attempts, and other basketball game event types. 
The play-by-play timeline should be realistic and the scoring should 
follow the competitive, high-scoring progression of typical NBA games.
