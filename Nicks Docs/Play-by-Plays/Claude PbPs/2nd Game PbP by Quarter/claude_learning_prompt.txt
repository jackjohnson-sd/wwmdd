COMMENT:

Claude is contradictory on its stance if it can learn from previous prompts...
But seems to have some ability to recollect from previous prompts/conversations 
based on continued high scoring pattern in new chat after I prompted competitive 
scoiring in the previous chat.

I asked specifically about hindsight because in Claude's previous response, it 
claims to should have done xyz in hindsight to create a more realistic scoring frequency

PROMPT:
How do you incorporate your "hindsight" into future interactions/prompts between you and I?
