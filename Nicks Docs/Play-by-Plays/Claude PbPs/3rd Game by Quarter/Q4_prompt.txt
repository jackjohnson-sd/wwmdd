COMMENT:
Final score is more realistic, lack of defensive plays,
How are the players missing the shots? Who is blocking them? 

At the end of the PbP, Claude includes a scoring summary of some players, which
hints at Claude's remembrance based on my previous chat where I asked for players' 
playing times and scoring summaries

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the fourth quarter of this game.
