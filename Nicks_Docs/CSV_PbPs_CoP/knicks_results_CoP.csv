Certainly! Let's start by creating the starting lineups for both teams:

**New York Knicks Starting Lineup:**
1. **Point Guard (PG):** Jalen Brunson
2. **Shooting Guard (SG):** Josh Hart
3. **Small Forward (SF):** Reggie Bullock
4. **Power Forward (PF):** Julius Randle
5. **Center (C):** Isaiah Hartenstein

**New Orleans Pelicans Starting Lineup:**
1. **Point Guard (PG):** CJ McCollum
2. **Shooting Guard (SG):** Brandon Ingram
3. **Small Forward (SF):** Herb Jones
4. **Power Forward (PF):** Zion Williamson
5. **Center (C):** Jonas Valančiūnas

Now, let's create the expected play-by-play for the first quarter. I'll include substitutions, defensive events, and scoring events. Each quarter is 12 minutes long:

| Period | Time | Team | Event Type | Player 1 | Player 2 | Description | Score |
|--------|------|------|------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1      | 12:00| NYK  | Tip-off    | Hartenstein | Valančiūnas | Game starts | 0-0   |
| 1      | 11:45| NOP  | Steal      | McCollum | (N/A)    | McCollum steals the ball | 0-0   |
| 1      | 11:30| NOP  | Layup      | Ingram   | (N/A)    | Ingram scores | 0-2   |
| 1      | 11:15| NYK  | Jump Shot  | Brunson  | (N/A)    | Brunson scores | 2-2   |
| ...    | ...  | ...  | ...        | ...      | ...      | ...         | ...   |
| 1      | 0:30 | NYK  | Substitution | Quick sub | (N/A) | Bullock in for Hart | 20-18 |
| 1      | 0:15 | NOP  | Defensive Rebound | Valančiūnas | (N/A) | Valančiūnas grabs the board | 20-18 |
| 1      | 0:05 | NOP  | Three-Pointer | McCollum | (N/A) | McCollum hits a three | 20-21 |
