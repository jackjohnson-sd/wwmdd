COMMENTS:

- I removed the xml tags.

- I edited the details on SUb events section to say that each team has 5 players on the court at any given time. 

-First quarter PbP has 5 players on each team.

-Second quarter PbP has same 5 players, and when a SUB occurs, there is only SUB out, no SUB in.

-Gemini4_results.csv is the results starting from prompt ((7)), where I advise Gemini based on genereated PbP.

-The first quarter of gemini4 is better for GSW, but OKC only has 5 players for all of first quarter.

In this chat session, I will eventually ask you to provide a hypothetical play by play for an NBA game between OKC and GSW that occurs during December 2023.

This first prompt is meant to provide you with context and guidance for creating a play by play. 

Do not provide a summary of this prompt. 

Here are play by play excerpts of a CSV formatted play by play of an NBA game between OKC and DAL:

Here is a description of the CSV formatted play by play:
For example, game score for the event are shown in the score feild.

If a team has not scored, their score is 0.

The initial score is 0 - 0

The score is the home team's score first then a '-' followed by the away team.

The game is over if at the end of the 4th or subsequent periods is not tied.

The below lines describe the playersâ€™ roles in the events in the CSV formatted play by play:

For example, the item in the eventmsgtype column is the type of basketball event and the player1_name 
column is the player committing the event. 

player1_team_abbreviation is the team that player1_name is a player on.

In some cases, the player2_name column is another player associated with this event. 

player2_team_abbreviation is the team that player2_name is a player on. 

For example, with the FOUL event, player1_name is the player committing the foul and player2_name is 
the player that is being fouled against by player1_name.

For example, with the STEAL.TURNOVER event, player1_name committed the turnover and player2_name is 
credited with the steal. 

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game. 

For example, with the REBOUND event, player1_name commits the offensive or defensive rebound and
has possession of the ball. 

For example, with the 3POINT.ASSIST event, player1_name makes the shot and player2_name is credited with the assist.

For example, with the FTMAKE event, player1_name makes the free throw. 

For example, with the 3POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block. 

For example, with the 2POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block.

Other eventmsgtype are:  
2POINT, 2POINT.ASSIST, 3POINT, 3POINT.ASSIST, FTMAKE, FTMISS, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 2POINTMISS.BLOCK  
3POINTMISS.BLOCK, REBOUND, STEAL, TURNOVER, STEAL.TURNOVER, FOUL, SUB, TIMEOUT, STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, JUMPBALL	


Details on SUB events:
Teams can only SUB players from their rosters at the time of the game.

In an NBA game, each team has 5 players on the court at any given time. 

Player substitution events, called SUB, occur throughout the game to manage playing time, foul trouble, and tactical adjustments. 

A player can only enter the game for their own team, replacing a teammate who must exit the court. 

There is no limit to the number of substitutions a team can make during a game.

Coaches aim to distribute playing time effectively to maintain player performance and prevent fatigue. 

Starters typically play around 32 minutes per game, while bench players usually play 16 minutes or less. 

Players generally play in 6-8 minute stints to stay fresh and competitive.

Substitutions are also made when players are in foul trouble. 

Each player is allowed 6 personal fouls before being disqualified from the game. 

Coaches may substitute players with a high number of fouls to avoid disqualification.

Tactical substitutions are made to match up against opposing players, change the team's playing style, or adjust to game situations.

These substitutions can occur at the beginning of each quarter or during timeouts.

For the SUB events in the example play by play, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game.

Here are the team rosters during December 2023:
OKC roster: Kenrich Williams, Jaylin Williams, Jalen Williams, Aaron Wiggins, Lindy Waters III, Cason Wallace, Olivier Sarr,
Mike Muscala, Keyontae Johnson, Isaiah Joe, Chet Holmgren, Gordon Hayward, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Josh Giddey, Adam Flagler,
Luguentz Dort, Ousmane Dieng, Bismack Biyombo

GSW roster: Stephen Curry, Usman Garuba, Draymond Green, Trayce Jackson-Davis, Jonathan Kuminga, Kevon Looney, Moses Moody,
Chris Paul, Gary Payton II, Brandin Podziemski, Lester Quinones, Jerome Robinson, Gui Santos, Dario Saric, Pat Spencer,
Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins

I have attached 4 complete play by plays of NBA games involving either OKC or GSW from December 2023.

Do not provide a summary; this message is for chat context and guidance on creating hypothetical play by plays.

((  2  ))
Provide the play by play for the first quarter of a hypothetical game between OKC and GSW on December 8, 2023 in CSV format that follows 
the CSV format of the attached play by plays.

In the hypothetical play by play, only use players from OKC and GSW team rosters during December 2023. 


((3))
Provide the second quarter play by play.

((4))
Why are you not subbing out the players to follow the typical 6 - 8 minute long player stint time that 
I prompted in the first prompt? 

Look at the example play by plays I attached to see what players' playing times should look like.


((5))
Continue with the third quarter play by play.


((6))
I see there are more subs for OKC. 
However, GSW still only has the same 5 players playing throughout the game. 
I provided the rosters for you and rules about SUBS: 
'Starters typically play around 32 minutes per game, while bench players usually play 16 minutes or less.

Players generally play in 6-8 minute stints to stay fresh and competitive.' 

Please provide the fourth quarter play by play with these rosters and rules in mind. 


((7))
Thank you for providing the play by plays for the four quarters. 

I'm going to give you tips now to improve the play by plays and ask you to re-provide the 
play by plays for this hypothetical game, taking into consideration my edits. 

GSW only had 5 of the same players throughout the entire game.
This is not desired. 

I want to see the starter players not play for more than 6 - 8 minutes before being subbed 
out for bench players. 

Starter players should not play for more than 32 minutes during the entire game. 

Bench players (players subbed in for starter players) should not play for more than 16 minutes 
during the entire game. 

Refer to the team rosters I provided in the first prompt. 

Now, re-provide the first quarter play by play for this hypothetical game between OKC and GSW 
following my edits. 

RESPONSE to ((7))
"You are absolutely correct! I apologize for the continued oversight with the player substitutions. 
I'm still under development and learning to apply complex rules like these consistently."


((8))
the GSW player stints and subs looks better. 
However, OKC only has the same 5 players for the first quarter. wWhy is this?


((9))
Provide the second quarter play by play with my feedback in mind. 


((10))
Make sure that 5 players are playing for each team at any given time for the game. 

Include more sub events for OKC, and more for GSW. 

For example, Josh Giddey has been playing for the entire game, when players should 
only play for 6 - 8 minutes before being subbed out, similar with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and 
Kenrich Williams. 

Provide the third quarter following these requests.
