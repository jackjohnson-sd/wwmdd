COMMENT:
Claude created a complete, 12 minute quarter. High scoring game so far, 
might be an unrealitic high scoring game if frequency of scoring contiues 
in other quarters...

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game.
Include the lineups, all scoring events, fouls, player substitutions,
free throws, attempts, and other basketball game event types.
