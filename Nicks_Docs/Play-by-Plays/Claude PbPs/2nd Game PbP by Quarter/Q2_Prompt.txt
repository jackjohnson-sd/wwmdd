COMMENT:
Unrealistic/high scoring persists in new chat, leading me to wonder how much context 
Claude carries from an old chat to a new chat (Claude claims each new chat rids previous chat
instructions/prompts) 
Claude is still seemingly following the prompt of "competitive NBA scoring"...

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the second quarter of this game.
