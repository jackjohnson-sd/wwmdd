COMMENT:
In its reasoning for playing LeBron for 40 minutes, Claude
demonstrates a dynamic understanding of factors affecting 
gameplay (fatigue, bench player performance, current situation in game)


PROMPT:
Would the Lakers have played better if LeBron James did not play 
for 40 minutes, and the coaches subbed in more rested, fresh
players to give LeBron recovery time?
