COMMENT:
Claude produces more realistic scoring frequency, which could be 
due to me asking it in the previous chat of the 2nd game 'why the 
scoring is so high' (paraphrased)

Claude is also generating a PbP with NBA teams that I usmentioned in previous 
prompts of pbp generations. This hints at a remembrance between chats... 
The question is, to what degree can it recall learned behavior from past chats? 

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game. 
Include the lineups, all scoring events, fouls, player substitutions, 
free throws, attempts, and other basketball game event types.
