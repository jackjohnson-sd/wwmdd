COMMENT:
Claude doesn't mention specific teams in the play-by-play, but refers to them as "home" and "away".
This issue hasn't been seen before, why did Claude "randomly" drop detail that's inherent to a 
basketball game? 

Also, to address my ask for it to include defensive plays, Claude adds 'defensive' infront of rebound.
I'll be prompting more specifically to gain better insights of defense in these generated games...

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game. Include the lineups, 
all scoring events, fouls, player substitutions, free throws, attempts, defensive plays, 
and other basketball game event types.
