COMMENT:
I asked it why it didn't mention team names, and Claude responded that it omitted them
to produce more relevant results, so the focus is on the plays and score. It asked if
I wanted to regenerate the first quarter with team names, but I continued to prompt it 
to generate the second quarter. That's why this PbP now has team names...

PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the second quarter of this game.
