COMMENT:

Claude's scoring frquency this game is about 1 point made every 9.8 seconds, whereas a 
typical NBA game has a scoring frequency of 1 point every 12.6 seonds. While that's not abhorent, 
Claude produces PbPs with structured scoring frequency (every 15 seonds is a scoring event) which
is unrealisitic.

PROMPT:
Whatâ€™s the typical scoring frequency in an NBA game?
