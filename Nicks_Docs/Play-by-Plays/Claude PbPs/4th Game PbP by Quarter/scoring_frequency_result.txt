RESULT:

The typical scoring frequency in an NBA game can vary depending on factors such as 
the teams playing, their pace of play, and the defensive intensity. However, on average, 
an NBA team scores around 100-115 points per game.

In the 2022-2023 NBA season, the average points per game for a team was 114.7. This means 
that, on average, a point is scored in an NBA game every 15-20 seconds of game time.

Here's a breakdown of the average scoring frequency based on the duration of an NBA game:

1. In a 48-minute game, there are 2,880 seconds of game time.
2. With an average of 229.4 combined points per game (114.7 points per team), we can 
estimate that a point is scored every 12.6 seconds (2,880 seconds / 229.4 points).

However, scoring is not evenly distributed throughout the game. There may be periods of 
higher scoring intensity and periods of slower play, depending on game situations, team 
strategies, and other factors. Additionally, the pace of play and scoring output can vary 
significantly between different teams and different eras of NBA basketball.
