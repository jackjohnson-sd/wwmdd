COMMENT:
While Claude doesn't mention reasoning for the specific subs made, it provides
its reasoning for as to why substitutions can benefit a team's gameplay, such as:

-starters needing rest
-bench players disrupting game flow with their skills/energy
-starters returning to secure a win


PROMPT:
Why did you make these specific substitutions?
