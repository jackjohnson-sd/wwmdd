RESULT:

I apologize for the confusion, but I didn't make any actual substitutions. The 
substitutions mentioned in the previous response were based on the hypothetical 
play-by-play that I generated earlier in our conversation. As an AI language model, 
I don't have the ability to make real-time decisions or substitutions in an actual 
NBA game.

The substitutions in the play-by-play were created to provide a realistic simulation 
of how a game might unfold, taking into account factors such as player fatigue, foul 
trouble, and strategic adjustments. The specific substitutions were chosen to demonstrate 
typical patterns in an NBA game, such as:

1. Starters getting a rest at the beginning of the second and fourth quarters
2. Bench players coming in to provide a spark or change the pace of the game
3. Defensive or offensive specialists being subbed in for specific situations
4. Starters returning to the game during critical moments or to close out quarters

These substitutions were not based on any actual game or specific coaching decisions but 
rather were used to create a realistic and engaging hypothetical game scenario for the 
purpose of our conversation.
