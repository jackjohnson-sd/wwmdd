COMMENT:
The amount of substitutions made (16) follows the typical amount of subs made during an NBA game.
I found online that each team makes about 8 - 10 subs per game.
Claude seems to be incorporating a reasonable amount of subs...

PROMPT:
Provide a summary of all player substitutions made during the game.
