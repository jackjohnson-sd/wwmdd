COMMENT:
Claude is 'remorseful' and recognizes that an NBA quarter is 12 minutes long, starting at 12:00 
and ending at 0:00.

I noticed the first scoring event that breaks the 15 second cycle (@ 3:12)
What prompted Claude to deviate from the previous structured scoring? 
And how can we replicate the more natural scoring seen without giving Claude
too many instructions (defense, subs, player time totaling 4 hrs, etc.)

PROMPT:
why did you end the first quarter with 4:35 left on the clock?
