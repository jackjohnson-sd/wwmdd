RESULT:

I apologize for the confusion. In an NBA game, each quarter lasts 12 minutes, 
and the clock counts down from 12:00 to 0:00. I should have continued the 
play-by-play until the end of the quarter at 0:00. Here's the continuation 
of the first quarter:

4:20 - Jaylen Brown makes a driving layup. Celtics 21, Bucks 21.
4:05 - Khris Middleton makes a 17-foot jumper. Bucks 23, Celtics 21.
3:45 - Grant Williams misses a 3-point attempt.
3:30 - Giannis Antetokounmpo makes a fadeaway jumper. Bucks 25, Celtics 21.
