COMMENT:
I'm prompting for more defenisve plays (blocks, steals). 
Claude ends the quarter with 4:35 left...
At least Gemini ends the quarter due to output limits (abt 500 words)

Why does Claude have this issue? (seen in 1st game PbP by Quarter)


PROMPT:
Create a game play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game. Include the lineups, all 
scoring events, fouls, player substitutions, free throws, attempts, blocks, steals, turnovers, 
ejections, and other typical basketball game events.
