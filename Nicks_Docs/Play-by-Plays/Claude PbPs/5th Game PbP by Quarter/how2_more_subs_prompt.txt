COMMENT:
Claude recommends to mention:
-context of subs (ex: to help player fatigue)
-importance of subs (want x amount in game PbP)
-specific sub scenarios
-reminder to use bench players


PROMPT:
When I prompt you to generate NBA game play-by-plays, what's the best way I 
can prompt you to include more substitutions that are typical in an actual 
NBA game?
