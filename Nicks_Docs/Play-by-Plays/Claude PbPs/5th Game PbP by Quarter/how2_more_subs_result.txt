RESULT:

To prompt me to include more substitutions that are typical in an actual 
NBA game, you can provide specific instructions and context in your prompt. 
Here are a few suggestions:

1. Mention the importance of substitutions: Emphasize that you want the 
play-by-play to include a realistic number of substitutions that would occur 
in an actual NBA game.

2. Provide context for substitution patterns: Specify that substitutions 
should be made to manage player fatigue, foul trouble, and matchups against 
the opposing team's lineups.

3. Include specific substitution scenarios: Ask me to include substitutions 
for specific situations, such as when a player reaches a certain number of 
fouls, when a team needs to change its defensive or offensive strategy, or 
when a team needs a spark off the bench.

4. Request a minimum number of substitutions: Specify a minimum number of 
substitutions you'd like to see per quarter or throughout the game to ensure 
a more realistic simulation.

5. Mention the use of bench players: Remind me to utilize bench players in 
the play-by-play, as they play a crucial role in real NBA games.

Here's an example prompt that incorporates these suggestions:

"Generate an NBA game play-by-play between the [Team 1] and [Team 2]. Please 
include a realistic number of substitutions throughout the game, similar to 
what would occur in an actual NBA game. Make substitutions to manage player 
fatigue, foul trouble, and to match up against the opposing team's lineups. 
Include at least 3-4 substitutions per quarter and utilize bench players as 
they would be used in a real game. Incorporate specific substitution scenarios, 
such as when a player reaches a certain number of fouls or when a team needs to 
change its strategy."

By providing this type of context and specific instructions, you can help me 
generate a more realistic play-by-play that includes a typical number of 
substitutions for an NBA game.
