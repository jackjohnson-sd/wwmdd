COMMENT:
Each time has missing player minutes...
The total playing time of all the players on one team should be 240 minutes 
(because there are 5 active players for 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 
minutes. And 5x4x12 = 240).

PROMPT:
Provide scoring summaries and playing times for each player over the entire 
game (all 4 quarters).
