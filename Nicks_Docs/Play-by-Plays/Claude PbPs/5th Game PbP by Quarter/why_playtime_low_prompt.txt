COMMENT:

The issue appears to lie within Claude's tracking of the players/subs rather than 
creating a game with less than 5 players and/or less than 12 minutes quarter. 

PROMPT:

The total playing time of all the players on one team should be 240 minutes 
(because there are 5 active players for 4 quarters, and each quarter is 
12 minutes. And 5x4x12 = 240). Why do the Bucks only have 187 minutes of 
total play time? (38+36+35+32+20+8+12+6=187) Why do the Celtics only have 
204 minutes of total play time? (40+38+28+24+12+20+22+16+4=204)
