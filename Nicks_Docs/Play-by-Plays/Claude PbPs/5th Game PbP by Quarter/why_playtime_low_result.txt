RESULT:

I apologize for the inconsistency in the total playing time for each team. 
In an actual NBA game, you are correct that the total playing time for all 
players on one team should add up to 240 minutes (5 players x 4 quarters x 
12 minutes). 

In the simulated play-by-play, I made substitutions but didn't accurately 
track the minutes for each player. This led to the discrepancy in the total 
playing time for both the Bucks and the Celtics.

To maintain consistency and accuracy, I should have ensured that the total 
playing time for each team added up to 240 minutes. Thank you for pointing 
out this error. In future simulations, I will be more careful to track playing 
time accurately and ensure that the total minutes for each team are consistent
with the rules of the game.
