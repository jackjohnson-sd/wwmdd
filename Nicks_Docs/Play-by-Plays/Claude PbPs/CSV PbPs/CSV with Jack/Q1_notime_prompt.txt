COMMENT:
Claude doesn't give us event times in PbP

PROMPT:

"create a hypothetical game"

but before I asked:
"give us a 1st quarter play by play for these two teams"
with Claude responding that it can't provide PbP of specific game (not what we were asking in 1st place)

and before that prompt I asked:

"what are all the players on the Mavericks during Jan 2022"
with Claude repsonding with an accurate roster.
That is why Claude responds with a PbP between Mavs and OKC...
