COMMENTS:
The uploaded CSV-formatted results are from prompts 5 -- 12.

From prompts 2 & 4, Claude repeated the example CSV-formatted PbP.

Prompting Claude to provide a game between 2 teams, where one team is not playing in the CSV example,
steers Claude to create a hypothetical game, rather than repeating the example play by play.

The example CSV-formatted play by play is between OKC and DAL, so I prompted Claude to provide a 
play by play of a game between OKC and GSW to have Claude provide a new game. 




PROMPTS:
1. 
Please ignore all prior examples of CSV formats and play by plays.

During a basketball game, different types of events occur. 

These include made shots, miss shots, fouls, rebounds, assists, turnovers, and player substitutions. 

We call these substitution events SUBS. 

In an NBA game, 5 players on each team can play at one time.

A player can only enter a game for his team, and when he enters, a player from his team must exit. 

It's important that a player not play too long for any one time. 

It's also important that a player not play too many minutes during a game. 

Coaches often substitute when a player does not seem competitive during a game. 

Coaches also make player substitutions when a player is in foul trouble. 

Our examples below shows only SUB events of a play by play for an NBA game between OKC and DAL. 

The example also shows the period, time, description of event, score, score margin, and the player who exited and the player who 
entered the game.

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game.
