COMMENTS:

Gemini 1.5 Pro requires continuous remindings of formatting (ie. commas for all columns even if there are no value in column).

Even with reminders and referencing the example CSV formatting, I still had to edit commas/formatting.

Also, when I ask for the next quarter PbP or to continue the current quarter PbP, it will provide a response without the PbP

Example responses: 
"Given that this is a fictional game, we will continue generating a plausible play-by-play for the remainder of the fourth quarter, maintaining consistency with the teams' rosters, play styles, and the established flow of the game from the previous quarters."

"The third quarter ended with the score 69-63, with OKC trailing GSW by 6 points. We will continue the play-by-play in the same format for the fourth quarter, maintaining consistency with the teams' rosters, play styles, and the established flow of the game from the previous quarters."

I asked it "where is the play by play" and "then please provide the play by play" to actually have a play by play...

There are fewer events in this PbP compared to Claude's PbP (300 vs. 427).

As of now, I believe an untrained Claude performs better than an untrained Gemini; however, Gemini is trainable through Google Cloud/Vertex AI, whereas Anthropic does not yet allow training of their LLMs.


PROMPTS:
1. 
Please ignore all prior examples of CSV formats and play by plays.

During a basketball game, different types of events occur. 

These include made shots, miss shots, fouls, rebounds, assists, turnovers, and player substitutions. 

We call these substitution events SUBS. 

In an NBA game, 5 players on each team can play at one time.

A player can only enter a game for his team, and when he enters, a player from his team must exit. 

It's important that a player not play too long for any one time. 

It's also important that a player not play too many minutes during a game. 

Coaches often substitute when a player does not seem competitive during a game. 

Coaches also make player substitutions when a player is in foul trouble. 

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game.
