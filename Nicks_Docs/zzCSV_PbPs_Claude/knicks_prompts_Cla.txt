COMMENT:
I'm using new prompt engineering techniques, such as role assignment (coach), numbered 
lists for instructions, and explicit mentions of desired results (ie. 20 - 25 subs).

These tips are from Anthropic's website. I'm investigating more prompt engineering 
techniques as well, but these techniques (such as listed instructions) have yielded 
(so far) consistent results (quarters all complete, subs made, mix of defensive and 
offensive plays). 

However, consistency is only true when prompts/results  are examined many times 
(not just 1 game)... More to come. 

PROMPT:


1. You are an NBA basketball coach for The New York Knicks creating your team’s lineup for a 
basketball game against The New Orleans Pelicans. 

Create the starting lineup for your team and the expected starting lineup of The New Orleans 
Pelicans.

Create an expected game play-by-play of the first quarter, with each quarter being 12 minutes long. 

In the play-by-play: 

Include the times of all events
Include 20 – 25 total player substitutions throughout the entire game to involve bench players and 
manage player fatigue.

Include defensive events, such as defensive rebounds and steals.

Include all scoring events that lead to the final scores.
