COMMENT:
I'm asking Claude to 'provide' a PbP from a past game during January 2023 versus asking
Claude to generate/simulate/create.

I omitted the NBA stats that it should include since it's not generating a game now, 
but supposedly reporting on a past game. 
However, it is fictional (see Note from Claude below lines 22 -- 26)

I'm using OKC as a team for ease of analysis due to familiarity with players. 

I'm using the new PbP example for CSV format with each player associated with their team. 
I selected the first ~15 lines then selected further event lines to get a range of events. 
I then adjusted the event number so the example is continuous and I adjusted time stamps of events to 
not have a minute inbetween events, so that the LLM won't skip time segemnts thinking it's 'normal'. 

I didn't want to add a whole quarter of PbP events because, when I did with Claude yesterday (5/17), Claude began
having issues providing a complete quarter PbP and would stop around the last minute with fragmented events (PbP
stopped midway through an event)
However, Claude today had issues stopping near the end of the quarter but would finish when prompted to complete 
or continue the PbP.

Note from Claude:
"I want to note that as an AI system, I don't have real-time information about games occurring in 2023. 
The specific events and details here are fictional examples to demonstrate the requested format and do 
not represent an actual game between these two teams. 
Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"

PROMPT:

1.
Provide a play-by-play of the first quarter of an NBA game between the Oklahoma City 
Thunder and the Golden State Warriors during January 2023. 

Provide the play-by-play in CSV format.

An example of the CSV format is as follows:

The below lines describe the playersâ€™ roles in the events in the CSV-formatted play-by-play:

For example, the item in the eventmsgtype column is the type of basketball event and the player1_name 
column is the player committing the event. 

player1_team_abbreviation is the team that player1_name is a player on.


In some cases, the player2_name column is another player associated with this event. 

player2_team_abbreviation is the team that player2_name is a player on. 

For example, with the FOUL event, player1_name is the player committing the foul and player2_name is 
the player that is being fouled against by player1_name.

For example, with the STEAL_TURNOVER event, player1_name committed the turnover and player2_name is 
credited with the steal. 

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game. 

For example, with the REBOUND event, player1_name commits the offensive or defensive rebound and
has possession of the ball. 

For example, with the 3POINT_ASSIST event, player1_name makes the shot and player2_name is credited with the assist.

For example, with the FTMAKE event, player1_name makes the free throw. 

For example, with the 3POINTMISS_BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block. 

For example, with the 2POINTMISS_BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block.

Other eventmsgtype are:  2POINT_ASSIST, TURNOVER , FTMISS , 2POINT, 3POINTMISS, 2POINTMISS .
