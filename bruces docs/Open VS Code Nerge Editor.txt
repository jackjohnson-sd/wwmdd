Here are the steps to open the conflict editor in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Windows 11 to resolve merge conflicts:
Open VS Code and navigate to the file with conflicts in the Explorer pane. You should see an exclamation mark (!) next to the file.
Right-click the file with conflicts and select "Git: Open in Merge Editor" from the context menu.
The Merge Editor will open with three sections:
Left: Incoming changes from the remote branch
Right: Your local changes
Center: The result of the merge
Resolve conflicts by selecting the checkboxes on the left and right sides or manually editing the code in the center section.
Once you've resolved all conflicts, save the file, stage it, and commit your changes.
To enable the Merge Editor, go to File > Preferences > Settings, type "merge editor" in the search bar, and check the "Open the merge editor for files that are currently under conflict" option under the "Git: Merge Editor" setting.
