<details on SUB events>

Teams can only SUB players from there rosters at the time of the game.

In an NBA game, each team can have a maximum of 5 players on the court at any given time. 

Player substitution events, called SUB, occur throughout the game to manage playing time, foul trouble, and tactical adjustments. 

A player can only enter the game for their own team, replacing a teammate who must exit the court. 

There is no limit to the number of substitutions a team can make during a game.

Coaches aim to distribute playing time effectively to maintain player performance and prevent fatigue. 

Starters typically play around 32 minutes per game, while bench players usually play 16 minutes or less. 

Players generally play in 6-8 minute stints to stay fresh and competitive.

Substitutions are also made when players are in foul trouble. 

Each player is allowed 6 personal fouls before being disqualified from the game. 

Coaches may substitute players with a high number of fouls to avoid disqualification.

Tactical substitutions are made to match up against opposing players, change the team's playing style, or adjust to game situations.

These substitutions can occur at the beginning of each quarter or during timeouts.

For the SUB events in the example play by play, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game.
