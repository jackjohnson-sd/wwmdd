-combining prompt 1 and 2, to be one context statement. 
-Claude answered Q 7 -- 9 correctly, but failed Q10. 

PROMPT 1:
    The following information details the structure and rules of quarters and fouls in play by plays of NBA games in CSV format.
    
    Quarter Rules: 
    A quarter, or period, in a basketball game is 12 minutes. 

    There are 4 quarters, or periods, in a basketball game. 

    If the teams' scores are tied at the end of the fourth quarter, then the game enters overtime and the fifth quarter begins. 

    In the CSV formatted play by play of a basketball game, the 'period' column contains numbers '1', '2', '3', or '4'. 
    '1' signifies the first quarter, or period.
    '2' signifies the second quarter, or period. 
    '3' signifies the third quarter, or period.
    '4' signifies the fourth quarter, or period.

    The 'pctimestring' column signifies the time remaining in the quarter or period.

    For example, this is an event row from a play by play in CSV format: 

    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    193,2POINT,2,0:59,Doncic 1' Driving Layup (39 PTS),64 - 62,-2,Luka Doncic,DAL,,,,

    Here, the game is in the second (2) quarter because '2' is in the 'period' column and there is 59 seconds left in the second quarter 
    because '0:59' is in the 'pctimestring' column. 


    FOUL Rules:
    In a FOUL eventmsgtype event, player1_name commits the foul against player2_name.

    An example of a foul event is here:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    18,FOUL,1,8:49,Lively II OFF.Foul (P1) (M.Kallio),9 - 7,-2,Dereck Lively II,DAL,Clint Capela,ATL,,

    ‘FOUL’ is in the eventmsgtype column which means this row describes a foul event.

    Dereck Lively II commits the foul because his name is named in the player1_name column. 
    player1_name is a player on the team DAL because ‘DAL’ is in player1_team_abbreviation. 
    player1_name is credited with the foul, which counts towards his and player1_team_abbreviation's foul counts.

    Clint Capela is the victim of player1_name's foul because Clint Capela is named in the player2_name column. 
    player2_name is not credited with the foul and the foul does not count towards his or player2_team_abbreviation's foul counts. 








6/13:
Prompt 2a:
    Refer to these foul rules when answering questions in this chat session.

Prompt 2b:
    Based on the play-by-play data and the FOUL rules I provided earlier, please find all the events where 'Josh Giddey' 
    is listed in the 'player1_name' column in rows where 'FOUL' is listed in the 'eventmsgtype' column. 

    These events indicate the fouls committed by Josh Giddey. 

    Please provide the exact event row(s) from the play-by-play data for the foul(s) committed by Josh Giddey, including 
    all the columns in the original format.


Discussion: 
Claude consistently pulls events which do not occur in the example game. 
Claude passed questions 1 and 2, but failed 3, 4, 5.
When asked how many fouls Josh Giddey committed, Claude responded with the correct toal but provided an
event row where Giddey is fouled against, not committing the foul. 

Claude seemed to acknowledge that it didn't follow my prompt, which leads me to wonder
how viable Claude will be in our applications. 

I added Prompt 2 (above) to the end of Prompt A when I began a new chat session, and Claude correctly 
answers Q 1 - 4, but fails 5.

When Claude provided the OKC fouls, it pulled Foul events where GSW commits the fouls. 

In its reasoning, Claude incorrectly references my foul rules, demonstrating a lack of comprehension.

I prompt Claude to give me feedback on my prompts to better address Claude's errors. 
That prompt is Prompt 2b. I sed this prompt in questions 3, 4, and 5, changing the names when applicable. 

Claude answered the questions correctly but the event rows pulled are inaccurate. 
The event is either missreported (wrong time, score, players) or an event where GSW commits the foul.
