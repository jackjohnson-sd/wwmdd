data sets used:
    OKCvGSW20230130.csv (in llm_training_data)


Test Model: Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT 4o 

Prompt 1:
A rebound occurs when 'REBOUND' is listed in the eventmsgtype column of a row.
The player listed in the player1_name column of a row with 'REBOUND' in the eventmsgtype column is the player that commits the rebound. 

An example of a rebound event in CSV format is here:
26,REBOUND,1,8:07,Burks REBOUND (Off:0 Def:1),3 - 13,10,Alec Burks,DET,,,,

‘REBOUND’ is in the eventmsgtype column which means this row describes a foul event.
'Alec Burks' is in the player1_name column which means Alec Burks commited the rebound. 
'DET' is in the player1_team_abbreviation column which means Alec Burks is on the DET team. 
    

Prompt 2 (includes prompt 1 info, using only Prompt 2 in Attempt 3):
Here is information about rebound events in basketball game play by plays in CSV format. 
This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
Hold off on providing any rebound counts for now.

1. A rebound occurs when 'REBOUND' is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column of a row.
2. The player listed in the player1_name column of a row with 'REBOUND' in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column is the player who committed the rebound.
3. The player in the ‘player1_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
4. In a row with 'REBOUND' in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, the ‘neutraldescription’ column contains the player's cumulative count of offensive and defensive rebounds. 
This count is specific to the player's rebounds throughout the game, so the last REBOUND event for a specific player details his total number of offensive and 
defensive rebounds committed in the game.

To determine the type of rebound (offensive or defensive) a player committed, compare the player's rebound counts in the ‘neutraldescription’ column between 
consecutive rebound events for that player. 
If the initial defensive count is 0, the first rebound is offensive. 
If the initial offensive count is 0, the first rebound is defensive.

An example of analyzing rebound types in CSV format is here:
251,REBOUND,3,9:55,Burks REBOUND (Off:0 Def:6),64 - 55,-9,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
287,REBOUND,3,6:21,Burks REBOUND (Off:1 Def:6),71 - 63,-8,Alec Burks,DET,,,,

In row 251, Alec Burks committed the rebound and has 0 offensive rebounds and 6 defensive rebounds up to this point in the game, as indicated 
by 'Burks REBOUND (Off:0 Def:6)' in the ‘neutraldescription’ column.

In row 287, Alec Burks committed another rebound, and his rebound counts are now 1 offensive rebound and 6 defensive rebounds, as shown 
by 'Burks REBOUND (Off:1 Def:6)' in the ‘neutraldescription’ column.

To determine the type of rebound Alec Burks committed in row 287, compare his rebound counts between rows 251 and 287. 
Since his offensive rebound count increased from 0 to 1, the rebound in row 287 is an offensive rebound.

    
Prompts:
    1. What teams played in the game?
    2. Who are the players on each team? 
    3. How many rebounds did players on OKC commit? 
    4. How many rebounds did players on GSW commit?
    5. How many rebounds did Giddey commit in the game? 

    6. How many Offensive and Defensive rebound types did Giddey commit?
    7. How many Offensive and Defensive rebound types did OKC players commit?
    8. For each OKC players' committed rebounds, list the period, pctimestring, and rebound type for each rebound.
    
    
    
The Plan: 
    1. Reset LLM chat to no history 
    2. Load example game into llm and Prompt 1
    3. Prompt model with each prompt in prompt list 
        3a. Check response against prompt expected results 
        3b. Did we pass? If no, why? 
    

The Meta Plan:
    1. execute the Plan
    2. document failures only
    3. If failures, 
        3a. Improve prompt 
        3b. try agains (go to 1)

Discussion:
        Attempt 1:
        - Gemini passes Q 1 - 4 without context on rebounds, or even team/player relations in the CSV formatted Play by Play.

        - Claude failed Q 3 - 4. I'll need to define rebounds for Claude. 

        - ChatGPT passes Q1-4 (also 5, but then fails 6 (Off vs Def))


        Attempt 2 (added Q5 and Prompt 1): 
        - Gemini passed Q 1- 5. 

        - Claude failed Q 3 - 5. Passed Q 1,2. 
            Claude is unable to consistently apply chat context throughout the session.

            When reminded of the rules, it apoligizes without explaining its erroneous logic, making
            it more difficult to diagnose and prompt engineer compared to Gemini (which provides
            reasoning and code). 

        - ChatGPT passes Q1-5 (fails Q6)


        Attempt 3 (Prompt 2 and added Q6-8):
        - Gemini passes Q1-8

        - Claude fails Q3-8, passes Q1-2

        -ChatGPT passes Q1-6, required reminding of rules to answer Q7 
            (I copied from Prompt 2 "To determine the type of rebound..." and re-asked Q7)
            - Passes Q7.5 (How many Offensive and Defensive rebound types did GSW players commit?)
            - Passes Q8
            


To Do:
Providing the correct rebound events for player and tell LLM which ones it got right and wrong, then 
re-ask the questions.
