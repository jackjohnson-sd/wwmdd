-Passes Q1,2,3,3a,3b,3d,4,4a,4b,4d, 5,5a,5b,

-Fails Q3c
    -It believed that he did not play in the third period, 
    because he did not have an entrance SUb event in the third period. 
    He entered near the end of the second period and exited around the middle of the third. 
-Passes Q3c
    -It added his 49 second playtime in end of 2nd to his 3rd period stint calculations, which is correct to due, but then
    it reports wrong start/end times because it adds 49 seconds to his stint in 3rd period (plays until 5:37 not 4:48)

-Fails Q4c
    -It became confused with ascending/descending times and start of period times.
-Passes Q4c

-Fails Q5c
    -It didn't realize to include all of period 3 in stint because no events mentioned in period 3
    
Q3c:
    1st Stint (1st Period): 7 minutes and 29 seconds (Entered at 12:00, Exited at 4:31)
    2nd Stint (2nd Period): 4 minutes and 37 seconds (Entered at 12:00, Exited at 7:23)
    3rd Stint (2nd Period): 0 minutes and 49 seconds (Entered at 0:49, Played till end of 2nd period)
    4th Stint (4th Period): 10 minutes and 4 seconds (Entered at 10:04, Played till end of 4th period)

    Follow-up:
    Some of these are correct. 
    Remember, if a playerâ€™s last SUB event in a period is him entering the court, then he plays 
    until the end of that period, and plays from the start of the next period, until he appears 
    in the 'player1_name' column of a SUB event row. 

    Q3c:
    1st Stint (1st Period): 7 minutes and 29 seconds (Entered at 12:00, Exited at 4:31)

    4th Stint (4th Period): 10 minutes and 4 seconds (Entered at 10:04, Played till end of 4th period)

    Follow-up:
    These numbers are correct. 
    However, in his 3rd stint, he enters at period 2, time 0:49 and plays until period 3, time 5:37. 
    What did you do?

    5th Stint (4th Period): 10 minutes and 4 seconds (Entered at 10:04, Played till end of 4th period)

    Follow-up:
    Some of these are correct. 
    Remember, the time value in the 'pctimestring' column descends and that periods begin at 
    '12:00' in the 'pctimestring' column. 

    Q3c:
    1st Stint (1st Period): 7 minutes and 29 seconds (Entered at 12:00, Exited at 4:31)
    2nd Stint (1st Period & 2nd Period): 4 minutes and 42 seconds (Entered at 0:26 in 1st period, Exited at 7:44 in 2nd period)
    3rd Stint (2nd Period): 10 minutes and 29 seconds (Entered at 2:55, Exited at 4:26 in 3rd period)

    3rd Stint: 5 minutes and 33 seconds (Entered at the start of the 4th period, Played till end of the 4th period)

    Follow-Up:
    Some of these are correct. 
    However, a player's start time is subtracted by his end time. 
    If a player is named in the 'player2_name' column of a SUB event row(enters game) in a period (ex: period 1) as 
    his last SUB event, and is named in the 'player1_name' column of a SUB event row (exits game) in period 3 as his 
    next SUB event, then he plays all of period 2. 
    Recalculate the incorrect results.

    Q5c:
    1st Stint: 12 minutes and 0 seconds (Entered at 12:00 in the 1st period, Played till the end of the 1st period)
    2nd Stint: 18 minutes and 58 seconds (Entered at the start of the 2nd period, Played till 10:04 in the 3rd period)
    3rd Stint: 5 minutes and 33 seconds (Entered at the start of the 4th period, Played till the end of the 4th period)
