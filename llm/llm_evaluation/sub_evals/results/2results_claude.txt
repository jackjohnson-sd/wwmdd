Q3:
Josh Giddey entered the game 3 times:

At the start of the game (period 0, time 0:00)
In the 2nd quarter (period 2, time 0:00)
In the 4th quarter (period 4, time 10:04)

Q4:
Based on the CSV data, Josh Giddey entered the game at the following times:

At the start of the game (period 0, time 0:00) - This is his initial entry as part of the starting lineup.
At the start of the 2nd quarter (period 2, time 0:00)
In the 4th quarter at 10:04 remaining (period 4, time 10:04)

So, excluding his initial start, Giddey made two substitution entries during the game.


Q5:
Based on the CSV data, Josh Giddey exited the game at the following times:

1. In the 1st quarter at 4:31 remaining (period 1, time 4:31)

2. At the end of the 3rd quarter (period 3, time 0:00)

3. At the very end of the game (period 4, time 0:00)

These exit times correspond to the "SUB: Giddey Exits" entries in the data. 
The last exit at the end of the game is part of the mass substitution that typically happens when the game is over.


Q6:
To calculate Giddey's stints, we need to look at the time between his entries and exits. Let's break it down:

1. First stint:
   Entry: Start of the game (period 0, 0:00)
   Exit: Period 1, 4:31 remaining
   Duration: 12:00 - 4:31 = 7 minutes and 29 seconds

2. Second stint:
   Entry: Start of 2nd quarter (period 2, 0:00)
   Exit: End of 3rd quarter (period 3, 0:00)
   Duration: 12:00 (2nd quarter) + 12:00 (3rd quarter) = 24 minutes

3. Third stint:
   Entry: Period 4, 10:04 remaining
   Exit: End of game (period 4, 0:00)
   Duration: 10:04 - 0:00 = 10 minutes and 4 seconds

So, Giddey's stints were:
1. 7 minutes and 29 seconds
2. 24 minutes
3. 10 minutes and 4 seconds
