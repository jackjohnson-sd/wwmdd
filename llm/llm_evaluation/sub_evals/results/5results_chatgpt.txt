- Prompt has information on determining players' overlap time playing.

- Fails Q9


Q9:
The entries and exits for both players were carefully analyzed, and no periods were found where both players 
were on the court simultaneously. 
This is reflected in the final overlap time calculation of 0:00. 
If you have any other queries or need further analysis, please let me know! ​​

If both entered at period 1, pctimestring 12, and giddey exits at period 1, pctimestring 4:31, then there is overlap. 
Does that make sense?

Yes, that does make sense. 
If both Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entered the game at the start of the first period (12:00) and Giddey 
exited at 4:31 in the first period while Shai exited at 4:15 in the first period, there should indeed be an overlap 
during this period.

I will recalculate the overlap with a more precise focus on each specific entry and exit time. 
Let's re-evaluate their playing times for potential overlaps in each period.

Entries and Exits for Verification:
Josh Giddey:

Entry Period 1: 12:00, Exit Period 1: 4:31
Entry Period 2: 12:00, Exit Period 2: 7:23
Entry Period 2: 0:49, Exit Period 3: 5:37
Entry Period 4: 10:04, Exit Period 4: 0:00
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:

Entry Period 1: 12:00, Exit Period 1: 4:15
Entry Period 2: 6:58, Exit Period 2: 0:56
Entry Period 3: 10:24, Exit Period 3: 1:12
Entry Period 4: 6:27, Exit Period 4: 0:00
Let's recalculate the overlap correctly:

Manual Overlap Calculation:
Period 1 Overlap:
Both entered at 12:00.
Giddey exited at 4:31.
Shai exited at 4:15.
The overlap in Period 1 is from 12:00 to 4:15.

I will go through each period similarly to calculate the overlap accurately.

The approach still seems to produce an unexpected result. Let's manually verify each overlap period again:

Detailed Verification:
Period 1:
Both Giddey and Shai entered at 12:00.
Giddey exited at 4:31.
Shai exited at 4:15.
Overlap Period 1: From 12:00 to 4:15 = 7 minutes 45 seconds (7:45).

Period 2:
Giddey entered at 12:00 and exited at 7:23.
Shai entered at 6:58 and exited at 0:56.
Overlap Period 2: From 6:58 to 7:23 = 25 seconds (0:25).

Period 3:
Giddey entered at 0:49 of Period 2 and exited at 5:37 of Period 3.
Shai entered at 10:24 of Period 3 and exited at 1:12.
No overlap in Period 3.

Period 4:
Giddey entered at 10:04.
Shai entered at 6:27.
Both played until the end of the period.
Overlap Period 4: From 10:04 to the end of the period = 6 minutes 27 seconds (6:27).

Total Overlap Calculation:
Period 1: 7:45
Period 2: 0:25
Period 3: 0:00 (no overlap)
Period 4: 6:27
Total Overlap: 7:45 + 0:25 + 6:27 = 14:37

Thus, the total overlap time for Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in this game is 14:37 minutes.
