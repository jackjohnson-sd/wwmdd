Here is information about basketball game play by plays in CSV format and SUB events. 
This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
Hold off on providing any SUB counts for now.

Here is information about team rosters:
- The player named in the ‘player1_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
- The player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
- The player named in the ‘player3_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player3_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.

Here is information about SUB events:
- For a SUB event row in CSV format, ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column. 
- In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column exits the game. 
- In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column enters the game. 
- The period the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘period’ column. 
- The time the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
- The format of the time is MM:SS (minutes:seconds) and the time represents time remaining in the period, and descends as the period progresses.  
- The period begins when ‘12:00’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
- The period ends when ‘0:00’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
- The event number is listed in ‘Col 1: ‘. Event numbers ascend as the game progresses. 

Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks Exits,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
89,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Livers Enters,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,DET,,
	
Alec Burks exits the game with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period, because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Alec Burks’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column.

Isaiah Livers enters the game with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period, because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Isaiah Livers’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column.


Here is stint information:
A player’s stint in basketball refers to a continuous period of time that a player spends on the court during a game before being substituted out.

A player’s total playing time in the game is equal to the sum of all of his stints. 

Here is an example of calculating a player’s stint time:
Example SUB events in CSV format:
,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
204,SUB,2,6:02,SUB: Bogdanovic Enters,50 - 34,-16,,,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,
252,SUB,2,1:12,SUB: Bogdanovic Exits,62 - 48,-14,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,,,

Notice that Bogdanovic enters the court in the second period with 6 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the second period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘6:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
Notice that Bogdanovic exits the court in the second period with 1 minute and 12 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘1:12’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column.
Bogdanovic’s stint time is 4 minutes and 50 seconds long because 6:02 minus 1:12 is 4:50.
	
	Here is another example of stint time calculations:
If a player has no exit SUB event listed in the period that he enters, but exits the game in the next period, then the player plays through the end of the period he entered and plays at the start of the next period. 

For example, these are 2 consecutive SUB events of a player: 

,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
111,SUB,1,0:50,SUB: Ivey Enters,35 - 18,-17,,,Jaden Ivey,DET,,
216,SUB,2,5:02,SUB: Ivey Exits,50 - 34,-16,Jaden Ivey,DET,,,,

Notice that he enters the court in the first period with 50 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:50’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 50 seconds in the first period because 0:50 minus 0:00 is 0:50.

Notice that he exits the court in the second period with 5 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘5:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 6 minutes and 58 seconds in the second period because 12:00 minus 5:02 is 6:58. 

The player’s stint is 7 minutes and 48 seconds long because 6:58 plus 0:50 is 7:48. 
	
Here is information about determining the length of time that two players were on the court together at the same time (playing time overlap):
For playing time overlap to occur, the two players must be named in the ‘player2_name’ columns of SUB event rows that occur before one of the players is named in the ‘player1_name’ columns of a SUB event row. This means that the two players must both have entered the game before one of the two players leaves the game for their playing time to overlap. 
Of the two players’ entrance SUB event rows, the later SUB event row (which is the row with the greater value in ‘Col 1: ‘) contains the period and pctimestring that is the start time of the two players’ playing time overlap. This is because both players must be on the court together for their playing time overlap count to begin.
The SUB event row (after the entrance SUB events) with one of the players of interest named in the ‘player1_name’ column contains the period and pctimestring that is the end time of their playing time overlap. This is because one of the two players exits the court, which ends their playing time overlap count.  
To calculate the two players’ playing time overlap for the game, sum the two players’ playing time overlaps from each period. 

Here is an example calculation of two players’ playing time overlap in a period to demonstrate the application of the above rules:
,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
220,SUB,2,5:12,SUB: Doncic Enters,50 - 34,-16,,,Luka Doncic,DAL,,
261,SUB,2,0:59,SUB: Dinwiddie Enters,60 - 45,-15,,,Spencer Dinwiddie,DAL,,
279,SUB,2,0:00,SUB: Doncic Exits,63 - 48,-15,Luka Doncic,DAL,,,,

Notice that the two players of interest (Doncic and Dinwiddie) are both named in ‘player2_name’ columns of SUB event rows (220, 261) before one of the players is named in the ‘player1_name’ columns of a SUB event row (279).
This means that Doncic and Dinwiddie played together in this period for some length of time before one of them exits the game. 
Because Dinwiddie’s entrance occurs after Doncic’s entrance, Dinwiddie’s entrance period and pctimestring (2,0:59) is used as the starting time for the two players’ playing time overlap. 

Notice that Doncic is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in a SUB event row (279). The period and pctimestring (2,0:00) in this SUB event row (279) is the end time of the two players’ playing time overlap. 

To calculate their overlap time in this period, the starting overlap time (0:59) is subtracted by the ending overlap time (0:00). The two players’ playing time overlap for this period is 59 seconds, because 0:59 minus 0:00 is 0:59.


Here is a more complicated example of calculating two player’s playing time overlap:

,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
4,SUB,1,12:00,SUB: Powell Enters,0,0,,,Dwight Powell,DAL,,
15,SUB,1,11:00,SUB: Finney-Smith Enters,0,0,,,Dorian Finney-Smith,DAL,,
61,SUB,1,5:31,SUB: Powell Exits,22 - 15,-7,Dwight Powell,DAL,,,,
72,SUB,1,4:28,SUB: Finney-Smith Exits,22 - 15,-7,Dorian Finney-Smith,DAL,,,,
101,SUB,1,1:50,SUB: Powell Enters,35 - 18,-17,,,Dwight Powell,DAL,,
117,SUB,1,0:26,SUB: Finney-Smith Enters,35 - 18,-17,,,Dorian Finney-Smith,DAL,,
174,SUB,2,8:40,SUB: Finney-Smith Exits,42 - 26,-16,Dorian Finney-Smith,DAL,,,,
226,SUB,2,4:02,SUB: Powell Exits,50 - 34,-16,Dwight Powell,DAL,,,,

The goal is to determine how many minutes and seconds that Dorian Finney-Smith and Dwight Powell played together in the first period and second period. 

Notice that the two players of interest (Dorian Finney-Smith and Dwight Powell) are named in ‘player2_name’ columns of SUB event rows (4 & 15) before one of the players is named in the ‘player1_name’ columns of a SUB event row (61).
This means that Finney-Smith and Powell played together in the first period for some length of time before one of them exits the court.

Finney-Smith’s entrance occurs after Powell’s entrance because Powell enters the court in event row 4, whereas Finney-Smith enters the court in event row 15. This means that Finney-Smith’s entrance period and pctimestring (1,11:00) is used as the starting time for the two players’ playing time overlap. 

Notice that Powell is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in a SUB event row (61). The period and pctimestring (1,5:31) in this SUB event row (61) is the end time of the two players’ playing time overlap, because Powell is the first of the two players to exit the court in this instance of playing time overlap.

To calculate Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s playing time overlap, the starting overlap time (11:00) is subtracted by the ending overlap time (5:31). The two players’ playing time overlap for this period is 5 minutes and 29 seconds, because 11:00 minus 5:31 is 5:29.

However, this is not Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s total playing time overlap in the first period, because the players re-entered the first period in SUB event rows 101 & 117. 
In SUB event row 101, Powell enters the court in the first period with 1 minute and 50 seconds left before the period ends.
In SUB event row 117, Finney-Smith enters the court in the first period with 0 minutes and 26 seconds left before the period ends.
Finney-Smith’s entrance period and pctimestring (1,0:26) is used as the starting time for the two players’ playing time overlap because Finney-Smith’s entrance occurs after Powell’s entrance.

Notice that Finney-Smith and Powell do not have exit SUB events in the first period after entering the court in SUB event rows 101 & 117. 

Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s following SUB events are exit SUB events in the second period, because Finney-Smith is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in SUB event row 174 and Powell is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in SUB event row 226. 

Because Finney-Smith and Powell do not have exit SUB events in the first period after entering the court in SUB event rows 101 & 117, Finney-Smith and Powell play until the end of the first period (pctimestring 0:00) and play from the start of the second period (pctimestring 12:00) until the players are named in ‘player1_name’ columns of SUB event rows in the second period. 

Therefore, Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s second instance of playing time overlap in the first period is 26 seconds long, because 0:26 minus 0:00 is 0:26.

Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s total playing time overlap in the first period is 26 seconds plus 5 minutes and 29 seconds, which equals 5 minutes and 55 seconds, or 5:55. 

To determine Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s total playing time overlap in the second period, it’s important to note that both players’s first SUB events in the second period are exit SUB events. 
This means that both Finney-Smith and Powell start playing in the second period at pctimestring 12:00, which is the start time for this instance of Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s playing time overlap. 

Notice that Finney-Smith is the first of the two players to exit the court in the second period, because Finney-Smith is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in SUB event row 174, whereas Powell exits later in the second period because Powell is named in the ‘player1_name’ column in SUB event row 226. 

This means that the pctimestring value (8:40) is the end time for Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s playing time overlap, because ‘8:40’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column in event row 174. 

Therefore, Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s playing time overlap in the second period is 3 minutes and 20 seconds, because 12:00 minus 8:40 equals 3:20.

Finney-Smith’s and Powell’s total playing time overlap in the second period is 3 minutes and 20 seconds, because Finney-Smith and Powell do not re-enter the court in the second period.
