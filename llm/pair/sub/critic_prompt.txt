<stints_in_CSV_format_information>
    A player's stint is his span of continuous gameplay. 
    The basketball game is broken down by players' stints. 

    Stints are in CSV format. 

    CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
    The first row contains the column names separated by commas. 

    The column names are as follows:
    PLAYER,TEAM,PERIOD.START,CLOCK.START,PERIOD.STOP,CLOCK.STOP,PLAY.TIME,OFF,DEF,±,PTS,REB,BLK,AST,STL,TO,PF,3P.MI,3P.MA,FG.MI,FG.MA,FT.MI,FT.MA,SUB.IN,SUB.OUT,EOQ,ORS,TF

    The subsequent rows are called stint rows.
    Each stint row describes a player's stint in the game.

<game_time_information>
    Game_time refers to the time an event occurs in a basketball game.
    
    Game_time uses the 'period' and 'pctimestring' values to determine when an event occurs in a game. 
    
    Game_time values are expressed in seconds. 

    A game begins with a game_time of 0 seconds.
    Game_time increases by 1 second as each second of the game is played. 
    A game ends with a game_time of 2880 seconds.
    
    Each period begins with a game_time of ('period value' minus 1) multiplied by 720 seconds. 
    Each period ends with a game_time of period begin game_time plus 720 seconds.

    This python code converts time from game_time format to period, pctimestring format:
        # Define the function pms
        def pms(_sec):  # p eriod m inute s econd
            
            q        = int(_sec / 720) + 1
            s_into_q = int(_sec % 720)
            m_into_q = s_into_q / 60
            s_into_m = int(s_into_q % 60)
            if s_into_m == 0: s_into_m = 60
            if m_into_q == 0 and s_into_m == 60:
                m_into_q = 12
                q -= 1
            s = f'{q},{int(12-m_into_q)}:{int(60-s_into_m):02d}'
            return s
