            Q7a:  How long did Giddey play in the second half of period 2?

                Response: 
                Josh Giddey did not play in the second half of period 2

                Follow-up:
                What are the game_times of the start and end of the second half of period 2?
                What are the game_times of the start and end of Giddey's stints in period 2?
                How long did Giddey play in the second half of period 2?

                Response:
                Given the corrected game_times for the start and end of the second half of period 2, and the game_times of Josh Giddey's stints in period 2, we can determine how long Giddey played in the second half of period 2 by checking the overlap between his stints and the second half of period 2.

                Second half of period 2: 1080 seconds to 1440 seconds
                Giddey's stints in period 2:
                First stint: 720 seconds to 997 seconds
                Second stint: 1391 seconds to 1440 seconds
                We see that the first stint does not overlap with the second half of period 2. The second stint overlaps as follows:

                Second stint: 1391 seconds to 1440 seconds
                The overlap duration is:

                1440−1391=49 seconds

                Convert the duration to Minutes
                format:

                49 seconds=0 minutes and 49 seconds

                Therefore, Josh Giddey played for 0 minutes and 49 seconds in the second half of period 2.

            Q7b: How long did Giddey play from time 11:57 to 9:56 in period 4?

                Response:
                Josh Giddey played for 1 minute and 1 second from 11:57 to 9:56 in period 4.

                Follow-up:
                game_time = (period*720) - (MM*60) - SS
                This is the conversion from period, pctimestring (period, MM:SS) to game_time. Recalculate.

                Response:
                Josh Giddey played for 0 minutes and 8 seconds from 11:57 to 9:56 in period 4.

            Q8c: How many minutes did Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander overlap in period 3?

            Response:
            Since Shai Gilgeous-Alexander did not play in period 3, the overlap duration is 0 seconds.

            Follow-up:
            Did you only look for SUB events in period 3 when figuring out Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's stints?

            Response:
            You are correct. I should look at all events, not just SUB events, to determine if Shai Gilgeous-Alexander played in period 3.

            Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander overlapped for 6 minutes and 23 seconds in period 3.

Attempt 3:

    ChatGPT:    
    - passes Q1 - 8a, 8d-e, 9a-10c
    - initially fails Q8b,c

        Q8b,c:
        How many minutes did Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander overlap in period 2?
        They overlapped for 7 minutes and 12 seconds.

        How many minutes did Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander overlap in period 3?
        They did not overlap in period 3.

        Follow-up:
        In period 3, what are relevant stints for overlap calculation?

        Response:
        Giddey's third stint: game_time 1391 to 1823
        Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint: game_time 1138 to 2276
        The overlap was calculated in period 2, and since it extends from period 2 into period 3, the relevant overlap has already been included. The game_time 1823 marks the end of Giddey's third stint. Thus, there is no additional overlap specific to period 3. Therefore, the overlap in period 3 is 0 minutes and 0 seconds.

        Follow-up:
        Why did you not seperate the overlap by end of period and start of period?

        Response:
        Period 2:
            Josh Giddey's Stints:
            Stint 2: From 12:00 to 7:23 in period 2 (converted to game_time: 720 to 997)
            Stint 3: From 0:49 in period 2 to 5:37 in period 3 (converted to game_time: 1391 to 1823)
            
            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's Stints:
            Stint 2: From 5:02 in period 2 to 10:04 in period 4 (converted to game_time: 1138 to 2276)
            
            For period 2, the relevant stints are:
            Giddey's second stint: game_time 720 to 997
            Giddey's third stint: game_time 1391 to 1440 (end of period 2)
            Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint: game_time 1138 to 1440 (end of period 2)
            
            The overlap calculation for period 2:
                Giddey's second stint (720 to 997) and Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint (1138 to 1440):
                No overlap, as Giddey's stint ends before Gilgeous-Alexander's stint starts.
        
                Giddey's third stint (1391 to 1440) and Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint (1138 to 1440):

                Overlap from 1391 to 1440: 
                1440 − 1391 = 49 seconds

                Converted to minutes and seconds: 
                49 ÷ 60 = 0 minutes and 49 mod 60 = 49 seconds

                Overlap duration: 0 minutes and 49 seconds

        Period 3:
        Josh Giddey's Stints:
        Stint 3: From 0:00 in period 3 to 5:37 in period 3 (converted to game_time: 1440 to 1823)
        
        Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's Stints:
        Stint 2: From 0:00 in period 3 to 10:04 in period 4 (converted to game_time: 1440 to 2276)
        
        For period 3, the relevant stints are:
        Giddey's third stint: game_time 1440 to 1823
        Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint: game_time 1440 to 2160 (end of period 3)
        
        The overlap calculation for period 3:
        Giddey's third stint (1440 to 1823) and Gilgeous-Alexander's second stint (1440 to 2160):

        Overlap from 1440 to 1823:
        1823 − 1440 = 383 seconds

        Converted to minutes and seconds: 
        383 ÷ 60 = 6 minutes and 383 mod 60 = 23 seconds

        Overlap duration: 6 minutes and 23 seconds

        Recalculated Results:
        Period 1: 7 minutes and 29 seconds
        Period 2: 0 minutes and 49 seconds
        Period 3: 6 minutes and 23 seconds
        Period 4: 5 minutes and 33 seconds
        Total overlap: 20 minutes and 14 seconds (as previously calculated, but now more clearly separated by period).

        2nd Stint: 18:58
        3rd Stint: 5:33?

        Response:
        We can add the durations of each stint to find the total playing time. We will convert each stint duration to seconds, sum them, and then convert the total seconds back to minutes and seconds.

        The total playing time is 36:31 (minutes:seconds).
