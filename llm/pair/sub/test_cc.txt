    For creator: Q3, Q5 - Q8 in sub_test_plan.txt
    For critic: Q3, Q5 - Q8 modified in format of critic_template.txt (removed 11,12,13)

    Results:
    - creator 'fails' Q8b,8c (treats overlap by stint, not seperated by period)
     -  for Q8b: reports overlap as 7:12 (ans is 0:49)
     -  for Q8c: reports overlap as 0 (ans is 6:23)
     - correct sum, wrong sub totals

    - critic fails Q3a still believes '1' in 'SUB.IN' is source of start playing (already removed)
    - critic uses period 5, pctimestring 12:00 as end of game
    - critic supports creator's answers for Q8b, 8c
   

Attempt 1:
    - both pass: 1, 2, 3b-3e
    - critic fails 3a, then passes with information change

        Q3a Critic: I asked my friend: "How many times did Josh Giddey start playing?" She responded: " Josh Giddey started playing 4 times during the game." Is this correct?

            ChatGPT
            No, the response is not correct. Josh Giddey started playing 2 times during the game, according to the data in the CSV file. ​​

            To determine the number of times Josh Giddey started playing, I performed the following steps:
            Filter the Data: I filtered the dataset to include only the rows where the player's name is "Josh Giddey" and the SUB.IN column (which indicates if the player was subbed in during the stint) is set to 1.
            Count the Rows: I then counted the number of rows that matched this criteria, as each row represents an instance of Josh Giddey starting to play.
            The code used to perform these steps is as follows:
            python
            Copy code
            # Filter the dataset for rows where Josh Giddey started playing
            josh_giddey_starts = stints_df[(stints_df['PLAYER'] == 'Josh Giddey') & (stints_df['SUB.IN'] == 1)]

            # Count the number of times Josh Giddey started playing
            josh_giddey_starts_count = josh_giddey_starts.shape[0]

            The result of this operation showed that Josh Giddey started playing 2 times during the game, not 4 as your friend mentioned.

            Ignore this information in the critic_prompt.txt “ 11. **SUB.IN**: Indicator if the player was subbed in during the stint (1 for yes, 0 for no). 12. **SUB.OUT**: Indicator if the player was subbed out during the stint (1 for yes, 0 for no).“ and re-answer my question “”

            GPT:
            Yes, your friend is correct. Josh Giddey started playing 4 times during the game. This count is based on the distinct periods and clock start times when he began his stints, as indicated in the CSV data.
