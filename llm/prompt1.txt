    <play-by-plays_in_CSV_format_information>
        Play-by-plays describe the events in basketball games. 
        Play-by-plays are in CSV format. 
        CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
        In CSV formatted play-by-plays, the first row contains the column names separated by commas. 
        The column names are the names of the values in the columns of a CSV row. 

        In the case of basketball game play-by-plays, the column names are as follows:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation

        The subsequent rows are called event rows.
        Each event row describes an event in the game.

        
        .1. The first column's optional value is the event number.
        Event numbers start at ‘0’ for the first event row.
        The following rows use sequentially numbered values. 

        .2. The second column is named ‘eventmsgtype’. 
        It identifies events that occur during the game.
        Eventmsgtype values are: STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, TIMEOUT, SUB, JUMPBALL, 3POINT.ASSIST, 2POINT.ASSIST, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 
        REBOUND, 2POINT, 3POINT, FOUL, STEAL, FTMAKE, FTMISS, STEAL.TURNOVER

        .3. The third column is named ‘period’. 
        It is a number that identifies the period the event occurs. 
        Basketball games include at least 4 periods. 
        Period values range from 1 - 4 and increase as the game progresses.

        .4. The fourth column is named ‘pctimestring’.
        It contains the time remaining in the period.
        It is formatted as minutes and seconds seperated by a colon.
        Its value descends in seconds as the game progresses.
        Its value is '12:00' at the start of each period. 
        Its value is '0:00' at the end of each period. 
        
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 7 minutes and 29 seconds before the end of the period. 
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 4 minutes and 31 seconds after the start of the period. 


        .5. The fifth column is named ‘neutraldescription’.
        It contains a brief description of the event. 

        .6. The sixth column is named ‘score’.
        It contains the two teams’ scores at the time of the event. 
        The initial score value is ‘0’.
        This means neither team has scored yet. 
        Once a team scores, the score value is formatted as ‘x - y’. 
        ‘x’ is a positive integer value that represents the away team’s score.
        ‘y’ is a positive integer value that represents the home team’s score.

        .7. The seventh column is named ‘scoremargin’.
        It contains the difference between the teams’ scores. 
        The value equals 'y' minus 'x'.

        .8. The eighth column is named ‘player1_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event.

        .9. The ninth column is named ‘player1_team_abbreviation’.
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player1_name’ player. 

        .10. The tenth column is named ‘player2_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event. 

        .11. The eleventh column is named ‘player2_team_abbreviation’. 
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player2_name’ player. 

        .12. The twelfth column is named ‘player3_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event.

        .13. The thirteenth column is named ‘player3_team_abbreviation’.
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player3_name’ player.

    <game_time_information>
        Game_time refers to the time an event occurs in a basketball play-by-play.
        
        Game_time uses the period and pctimestring values to determine when an event occurs in a game. 
        
        Game_time values are expressed in seconds. 

        A game begins with a game_time of 0 seconds.
        Game_time increases by 1 second as each second of the game is played. 
        A game ends with a game_time of 2880 seconds.
        
        Each period begins with a game_time of ('period value' minus 1) multiplied by 720 seconds. 
        Each period ends with a game_time of period begin game_time plus 720 seconds.

        This python code converts time from game_time format to period, pctimestring format:
            # Define the function pms
            def pms(_sec):  # p eriod m inute s econd
                
                q        = int(_sec / 720) + 1
                s_into_q = int(_sec % 720)
                m_into_q = s_into_q / 60
                s_into_m = int(s_into_q % 60)
                if s_into_m == 0: s_into_m = 60
                if m_into_q == 0 and s_into_m == 60:
                    m_into_q = 12
                    q -= 1
                s = f'{q},{int(12-m_into_q)}:{int(60-s_into_m):02d}'
                return s
    </game_time_information>

    <SUB_event_information>
        - ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a SUB event row. 

        - In a SUB event row, the ‘player2_name’ column player starts playing.
        This players playing time started at the game_time calculated using the values listed in the 'period' and ‘pctimestring’ columns of that row. 

        - In a SUB event row, the ‘player1_name’ column player ends playing.
        This players playing time ended at the game_time calculated using the values listed in the 'period' and ‘pctimestring’ columns of that row. 
    </SUB_event_information>

    <SUB_event_example>
        Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks Exits,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
        89,SUB,2,9:15,SUB: Livers Enters,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,NYC,,
            
        In event row 88, Alec Burks playing for DET ends his playing time with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in period 1.

        This is because: 
            - ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column
            - ‘Alec Burks’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column
            - ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column 
            - ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
            - 'DET' is the team 'Alec Burks' plays for because ‘DET’ is listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column. 

        In event row 89, Isaiah Livers playing for NYC starts his playing time with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in period 2.
        
        This is because: 
        - ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column
        - ‘Isaiah Livers’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column
        - ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column
        - ‘9:15’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
        - 'NYC' is the team ‘Isaiah Livers’ plays for because ‘NYC’ is listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column. 
    </SUB_event_example>
                                   
    <stint_information>
        - A stint begin is the game_time a player starts playing.
        - A stint end is the game_time a player stops playing. 
        - A stint duration is the difference between the stint end game_time and the stint begin game_time. 
        - When a stint begins in one period and ends in a later period, calculate the stint duration as the difference between the game_time for the stint end and the game_time for the stint begin.
        - A player can play in multiple stints per period and game. 
        - A stint is expressed as stint begin, stint end, stint duration.  
    </stint_information>

    <stint_calculation_example>
        Example SUB events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        204,SUB,2,6:02,SUB: Bogdanovic Enters,50 - 34,-16,,,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,
        252,SUB,2,1:12,SUB: Bogdanovic Exits,62 - 48,-14,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,,,


        In event row 204, Bojan Bogdanovic starts a stint at 2, 6:02.
        
        This is because: 
        - ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column
        - ‘Bojan Bogdanovic’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column
        - ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column
        - ‘6:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
        - DET is the team Bojan Bogdanovic plays for because DET is listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column. 

        In event row 252, Bojan Bogdanovic ends a stint at 2, 1:12.
        
        This is because: 
        - ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column
        - ‘Bojan Bogdanovic’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column
        - ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column
        - ‘1:12’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
        - DET is the team Bojan Bogdanovic plays for because DET is listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column. 

        We know Bogdanovic’s duaration for this stint is 4:50.
        This is because his stint start time is 2,6:02 and his stint end time is 2,1:12.
        The stint duration is the end time minus the start time, or 4:50.

    <overlap_information>
        - Overlaps are when two or more players play at the same time.
    </overlap_information>

    <overlap_examples>
        Example A:
        - playerA played from period 1, 5:00 to period 1, 3:00
        - playerB played from period 1, 4:00 to period 1, 2:00 
        - Their overlap would be 1 minute.

        Example B:
        - playerA played from period 1, 10:00 to period 1, 5:00
        - playerB played from period 1, 7:00 to period 1, 3:00
        - Their overlap would be 2 minutes.

        Example C:
