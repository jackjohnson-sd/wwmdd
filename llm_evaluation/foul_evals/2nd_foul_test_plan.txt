Prompt 1:
    <preamble_to_prompt>
        Here is information about basketball game play-by-plays in CSV format. 
        This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
        Hold off on providing any summaries and/or answers for now.
    </preamble_to_prompt>

    <information_on_play-by-plays_in_CSV_format>
        Play-by-plays describe the events in basketball games. 
        Play-by-plays are in CSV format. 
        CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
        In CSV formatted play-by-plays, the first row contains the column names separated by commas. 
        The column names are the names of the values in the columns of a CSV row. 

        In the case of basketball game play-by-plays, the column names are as follows:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation

        The subsequent rows are called event rows.
        Event rows describe the events in the game.

        
        .1. The first column's optional value is the event number.
        Event numbers start at ‘0’ for the first event row.
        The following rows use sequentially numbered values. 

        .2. The second column is named ‘eventmsgtype’. 
        It identifies events that occur during the game.
        Eventmsgtype values are: STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, TIMEOUT, SUB, JUMPBALL, 3POINT.ASSIST, 2POINT.ASSIST, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 
        REBOUND, 2POINT, 3POINT, FOUL, STEAL, FTMAKE, FTMISS, STEAL.TURNOVER

        .3. The third column is named ‘period’. 
        It is a number that identifies the period the event occurs. 
        Basketball games include at least 4 periods. 
        Period values range from 1 - 4 and increase as the game progresses.

        .4. The fourth column is named ‘pctimestring’.
        It contains the time remaining in the period.
        It is formatted as minutes and seconds seperated by a colon.
        Its value descends in seconds as the game progresses.
        Its value is '12:00' at the start of each period. 
        Its value is '0:00' at the end of each period. 
        
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 7 minutes and 29 seconds before the end of the period. 
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 4 minutes and 31 seconds after the start of the period. 


        .5. The fifth column is named ‘neutraldescription’.
        It contains a brief description of the event. 

        .6. The sixth column is named ‘score’.
        It contains the two teams’ scores at the time of the event. 
        The initial score value is ‘0’.
        This means neither team has scored yet. 
        Once a team scores, the score value is formatted as ‘x - y’. 
        ‘x’ is a positive integer value that represents the away team’s score.
        ‘y’ is a positive integer value that represents the home team’s score.

        .7. The seventh column is named ‘scoremargin’.
        It contains the difference between the teams’ scores. 
        The value equals 'y' minus 'x'.

        .8. The eighth column is named ‘player1_name’.
        It contains the name of the player involved in the event.

        .9. The ninth column is named ‘player1_team_abbreviation’.
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column. 

        .10. The tenth column is named ‘player2_name’.
        It contains the name of a player involved in the event. 

        .11. The eleventh column is named ‘player2_team_abbreviation’. 
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column. 

        .12. The twelfth column is named ‘player3_name’.
        It contains the name of a player involved in the event.

        .13. The thirteenth column is named ‘player3_team_abbreviation’.
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player3_name’ column. 
    </information_on_play-by-plays_in_CSV_format>

    <information_on_FOUL_events>
        - ‘FOUL’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column signifies a foul event.
        This row is a FOUL event row. 

        - In a FOUL event row, the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column commits the foul.
        player1_name is credited with committing the foul. 

        - In a FOUL event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is the victim of player1_name's foul.
        player2_name is not credited with committing the foul.  


        Here is an example of FOUL events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        18,FOUL,1,8:49,Lively II OFF.Foul (P1) (M.Kallio),9 - 7,-2,Dereck Lively II,DAL,Clint Capela,ATL,,
 
        In event row 18, Dereck Lively II committed the foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
                
        This is because ‘FOUL’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Dereck Lively II’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, 
        and ‘8:49’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
        
        player1_name is on the team DAL because ‘DAL’ is listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column. 
        player1_name is credited with the foul, which counts towards his and player1_team_abbreviation's foul counts.
                
        In event row 18, Clint Capela is the victim of player1_name's foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
            
        This is because ‘FOUL’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Clint Capela’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, 
        and ‘8:49’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 

        player2_name is on the team ATL because ‘ATL’ is listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column.
