ANSWER comparison:

    1. Results of Re-doing from Start 

    The answers I provided match the information in the answer file exactly. The answer file confirms that:

    The teams playing were the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Golden State Warriors.
    It lists the same players for each team as I mentioned in my response.
    The individual foul counts for each Oklahoma City Thunder player are identical to what I provided.
    The total number of fouls committed by the Oklahoma City Thunder (18) is the same as what I calculated.

    Therefore, my answers are fully consistent with the information provided in the answer file.


    2. Pickled Response File (Several items changed)

        After comparing my answers to the information provided in not_babe_ruth.txt, I found several discrepancies:

        1. The Oklahoma City Thunder player "Kenrich Williams" is not listed in the text file, but "Billy Bob" is mentioned instead.

        2. The Golden State Warriors player "Klay Thompson" is not listed in the text file, but "Edgar Rice" is mentioned instead.

        3. The foul counts for some Oklahoma City Thunder players differ from my answers:
        - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is listed as committing 13 fouls in the text file, but I stated he committed 3 fouls.
        - Jalen Williams is listed as committing 7 fouls in the text file, but I stated he committed 1 foul.
        - Isaiah Joe is listed as committing 0 fouls in the text file, but I stated he committed 3 fouls.

        4. The total number of fouls committed by the Oklahoma City Thunder is listed as 18 in the text file, which matches my answer. However, the individual foul counts in the text file do not add up to 18.

        In summary, while the teams playing in the game are consistent between my answers and the text file, there are discrepancies in the player names and foul counts for individual players.
