NAME: Fouls Test Plan 

data sets used:
    OKCvGSW20230130.CSV  (in llm_training_data)

Test Model: Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro 

Prompt 1:
    In a FOUL eventmsgtype event, player1_name commits the foul against player2_name.

    An example of a foul event is here:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    18,FOUL,1,8:49,Lively II OFF.Foul (P1) (M.Kallio),9 - 7,-2,Dereck Lively II,DAL,Clint Capela,ATL,,

    ‘FOUL’ is in the eventmsgtype column which means this row describes a foul event.

    Dereck Lively II commits the foul because his name is named in the player1_name column. 
    player1_name is a player on the team DAL because ‘DAL’ is in player1_team_abbreviation. 
    player1_name is credited with the foul, which counts towards his and player1_team_abbreviation's foul counts.

    Clint Capela is the victim of player1_name's foul because Clint Capela is named in the player2_name column. 
    player2_name is not credited with the foul and the foul does not count towards his or player2_team_abbreviation's foul counts. 

    Please do not provide event rows with your answers, just the number of fouls or what the question is asking explicitly.

Prompt 2:
    A quarter, or period, in a basketball game is 12 minutes. 

    There are 4 quarters, or periods, in a basketball game. 

    If the teams' scores are tied at the end of the fourth quarter, then the game enters overtime and the fifth quarter begins. 

    In the CSV formatted play by play of a basketball game, the 'period' column contains numbers '1', '2', '3', or '4'. 
    '1' signifies the first quarter, or period.
    '2' signifies the second quarter, or period. 
    '3' signifies the third quarter, or period.
    '4' signifies the fourth quarter, or period.

    The 'pctimestring' column signifies the time remaining in the quarter or period.

    For example, this is an event row from a play by play in CSV format: 
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    193,2POINT,2,0:59,Doncic 1' Driving Layup (39 PTS),64 - 62,-2,Luka Doncic,DAL,,,,
    Here, the game is in the second (2) quarter because '2' is in the 'period' column and there is 59 seconds left in the second quarter 
    because '0:59' is in the 'pctimestring' column.

Discussion:
        Attempt 1:

        Both Gemini and Claude passed questions_1 prompt when compared to the babe_ruth.txt file. 

        Q7: Gemini shows a lack of understanding of what the first quarter is, believing that times 
        before the 7 minute mark are in the first quarter, when the quarter is listed in the period column. 
        
        Gemini did answer correctly though, with Giddey having zero fouls committed in the first quarter.

        Q7: Claude incorrectly answers Giddey's foul count for the first quarter, believing he committed 1 foul.

        I'm moving on to Q 8 -- 10 before adjusting prompts... 

        Q8: Claude correct, Gemini incorrect. 

        Q9: Both incorrect, Claude says he commits 1 third quarter and 1 in fourth quarter. 
            Gemini says he commits 0 fouls in the third and fourth quarter. 

        Q10: Both answered correctly, "0 more fouls"

        Attempt 2:
        In Prompt 2, I defined what a quarter, or period, is to the LLMS and re-asked questions 7 -- 10 (the ones failed by the LLMs)
        
        Claude failed with Prompt 2 addition. 

        Gemini passed Q7 -- Q10.

        Attempt 3:
        After editing Prompt 1 with Prompt 2 content, Claude passed Q7 -- 9, but failed Q10. 
    
        Monday Morning:
        -Gemini passes Q 1 - 10 with prompt 1 (quarter rules and foul rules)
        
        -Claude passes Q 1 - 9, fails Q10. It correctly provides the OKC foul count, but believed GSW committed 19 fouls.
