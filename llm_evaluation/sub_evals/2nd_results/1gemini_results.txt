-Passes Q1,
-Fails Q2 (Aaron Wiggins)
-Fails Q3c
    -Gemini needs more details about start and end of periods, stints when players overlap quarters 

Q2:
    OKC: Kenrich Williams, Josh Giddey, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, Mike Muscala, Tre Mann, Darius Bazley, 
    Ousmane Dieng, Isaiah Joe, Jaylin Williams

    GSW: Andrew Wiggins, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Jordan Poole, Jonathan Kuminga, Donte DiVincenzo, 
    Anthony Lamb, Kevon Looney, Aaron Wiggins

    Follow-up:
    Is Aaron Wiggins on OKC or GSW?

    Q2:
    The data shows Aaron Wiggins played for both OKC and GSW. 
    This is likely an error in the data. 
    It is unusual for a player to play for two different teams in a single game.

    Follow-up:
    When 'Aaron Wiggins' is mentioned in the 'player1_name' column, what value appears in the 'player1_team_abbreviation' column?

    Q2:
    OKC

    Follow-up:
    Does 'GSW' appear in the 'player1_team_abbreviation' column when 'Aaron Wiggins' appears in the 'player1_name' column?

    Q2:
    No

Q3c:
    Giddey's stint durations (Minutes:Seconds):
    -5:23
    -7:37
    -6:27
    -1:11

    The negative values likely indicate an error in the data, as stint durations cannot be negative.
