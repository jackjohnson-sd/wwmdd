- Passes Q1 - 3b, 3d, 4-4d, 5 - 5d, 6-6a, 7, 8
- Initially fails Q3c
- Initialy fails Q8a

Q3c:
    Entered at Period 1, Time 12:00 and exited at Period 2, Time 7:23 - Stint Duration: 7:23
    Entered at Period 2, Time 0:49 and exited at Period 3, Time 5:37 - Stint Duration: 16:48
    Entered at Period 2, Time 12:00 and exited at Period 4, Time 0:00 - Stint Duration: 12:00

    Follow-up:
    There are missing SUB events. 
    Remember when he entered and exited. 
    Subtract the time he entered by the time he exited. 
    If he doesn't exit the court in a period, he plays until the end (0:00). 
    There are 60 seconds in one minute. 

    Q3c:
    Entered at Period 1, Time 12:00 and exited at Period 1, Time 4:31 - Stint Duration: 7:29
    Entered at Period 2, Time 12:00 and exited at Period 2, Time 7:23 - Stint Duration: 4:37
    Entered at Period 2, Time 0:49 and exited at Period 3, Time 5:37 - Stint Duration: 7:12
    Entered at Period 4, Time 10:04 and exited at Period 4, Time 0:00 - Stint Duration: 10:04

Q8a:
    Entry and Exit Times in Period 2
    Josh Giddey Entry and Exit:

    Entered: 12:00
    Exited: 7:23
    Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Entry and Exit:

    Entered: 5:02
    Exited: No exit recorded in period 2 (assume end of period, 0:00)
    Calculate Overlap Duration
    Start Time: The latest entry time (5:02)
    End Time: The earliest exit time (7:23 for Giddey, 0:00 for Gilgeous-Alexander)
    Since Gilgeous-Alexander did not exit during the period, the end time will be the end of the period.

    So, the overlap duration in the second period is 5 minutes and 22 seconds.

    Follow-up:
    To calculate overlap time, examine all SUB events of two players and determine if both players have entered the court at 
    times before one of the players exits the court. 
    A player is on the court before his exit SUB event, and after his enter SUB event.

    Q8a:
    Josh Giddey:

    Entered: 12:00
    Exited: 7:23
    Re-entered: 0:49 (and continued into period 3)
    Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:

    Entered: 5:02
    No exit recorded in period 2 (assume end of period, 0:00)
    Steps to Determine Overlap
    Identify intervals when both players are on the court:

    Giddey: [12:00 to 7:23], [0:49 to end of period]
    Gilgeous-Alexander: [5:02 to end of period]
    Calculate overlaps:

    First interval: Overlap between [5:02 to 7:23]
    Second interval: Overlap between [0:49 to end of period]

    Total overlap in seconds = 141 + 69 = 210 seconds
    Converted to minutes and seconds: 210 seconds = 3 minutes and 30 seconds

    So, the overlap duration in the second period is 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

    Follow-up:
    If a player exits before another player enters, then there is no overlap time.  re-calculate


    Q8a:
    Entry and Exit Times in Period 2
    
    Josh Giddey:
    Entered: 12:00
    Exited: 7:23
    Re-entered: 0:49 (and continued into period 3)
    
    Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:
    Entered: 5:02
    No exit recorded in period 2 (assume end of period, 0:00)

    Steps to Determine Overlap
    Identify intervals when both players are on the court:
    Giddey: [12:00 to 7:23], [0:49 to end of period]
    Gilgeous-Alexander: [5:02 to end of period]

    Calculate Overlaps with the Condition
    
    Check First Interval:
    Giddey: [12:00 to 7:23]
    Gilgeous-Alexander: [5:02 to end of period]
    No overlap, because Giddey exits before Gilgeous-Alexander enters.
    
    Check Second Interval:
    Giddey: [0:49 to end of period]
    Gilgeous-Alexander: [5:02 to end of period]
    Overlap: Only in the interval where both are on the court [0:49 to end of period].
    
    Calculate Valid Overlaps
    Valid Interval (0:49 to end of period):
    Start time: 0:49 (49 seconds remaining, game time = 1371)
    End time: 0:00 (end of period, game time = 1440)
    Overlap: 1440 - 1371 = 69 seconds
    
    Total Valid Overlap
    Total overlap in seconds = 69 seconds
    Converted to minutes and seconds: 69 seconds = 1 minute and 9 seconds

    So, the overlap duration in the second period is 1 minute and 9 seconds.
