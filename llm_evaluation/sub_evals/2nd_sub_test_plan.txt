Prompt 1:
    Here is information about basketball game play-by-plays in CSV format. 
    This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
    Hold off on providing any summaries and/or answers for now.

    <information on play-by-plays in CSV format>
    Play-by-plays describe the events in basketball games. 
    Play-by-plays are in CSV format. 
    CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
    In CSV formatted play-by-plays, the first row contains the column names separated by commas. 
    The column names are the names of the values in the columns of a CSV row. 

    The following rows are called event rows and describe the events in the game.
    In the case of basketball game play-by-plays, the column names are as follows:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    
    .1. The first column's optional value is the event number.
     Event numbers start at ‘0’ for the first event row.
     The following rows use sequentially numbered values. 

    .2. The second column is named ‘eventmsgtype’. 
    It identifies events that occur during the game.
    Eventmsgtype values are: STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, TIMEOUT, SUB, JUMPBALL, 3POINT.ASSIST, 2POINT.ASSIST, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 
    REBOUND, 2POINT, 3POINT, FOUL, STEAL, FTMAKE, FTMISS, STEAL.TURNOVER

    .3. The third column is named ‘period’ 
    It is a number that identifies the period the event occurs. 
    Basketball games include at least 4 periods. 
    Period values range from 1 - 4 and increase as the game progresses.

    .4. The fourth column is named ‘pctimestring’.
    It contains the time remaining in the period.
    It is formatted as minutes and seconds seperated by a colon.
    Its value descends in seconds as the game progresses.
    Its value is '12:00' at the start of each period. 
    Its value is '0:00' at the end of each period. 
    
    For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 7 minutes and 29 seconds before the end of the period. 
    For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 4 minutes and 31 seconds after the start of the period. 

        Game time:
        Game time refers to the time an event occurs in the basketball play-by-play.
        
        Game time uses the period and pctimestring values to determine when an event occurs into a game. 
        
        Game time values are expressed in seconds. 

        A game begins with a game time of 0 seconds.
        Game time increases by 1 second as each second of the game is played. 
        A game ends with a game time of 2880 seconds.
        
        Each period begins with a game time of ('period value' minus 1) multiplied by 720 seconds. 
        Each period ends with a game time of period begin game time plus 720 seconds.


    .5. The fifth column is named ‘neutraldescription’ and contains a brief description of the event occurring in the event row. 

    .6. The sixth column is named ‘score’.
    It contains the two teams’ scores when the event in the event row occurred. 
    The initial score value is ‘0’.
    This means neither team has scored yet. 
    Once a team scores, the score value is formatted as ‘x - y’. 
    ‘x’ is a positive integer value that represents the away team’s score.
    ‘y’ is a positive integer value that represents the home team’s score.

    .7. The seventh column is named ‘scoremargin’.
    It contains the difference between the teams’ scores. 
    The difference is calculated by subtracting the away team’s score by the home team's score. 

    .8. The eighth column is named ‘player1_name’.
    It contains the name of the player involved in the event that the event row describes. 

    .9. The ninth column is named ‘player1_team_abbreviation’.
    It contains the team abbreviation of the team that the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column is on. 

    .10. The tenth column is named ‘player2_name’.
    It contains the name of a player involved in the event that the event row describes. 

    .11. The eleventh column is named ‘player2_team_abbreviation’. 
    It contains the team abbreviation of the team that the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is on. 

    .12. The twelfth column is named ‘player3_name’.
    It contains the name of a player involved in the event that the event row describes. 

    .13. The thirteenth column is named ‘player3_team_abbreviation’.
    It contains the team abbreviation of the team that the player named in the ‘player3_name’ column is on. 
    </information on play-by-plays in CSV format>

    <information on SUB events>
    ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column of an event row signifies a substitution event.
    This row is a SUB event row. 
    - In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column exits the court.
    His playing time ends at the time value listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column of that row. 
    - In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column enters the court.
    His playing time starts at the time value listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column of that row. 
    -If a player is named in the 'player2_name' coumn in his last SUB event of a period, then he plays until the end of that period.
    He also continues playing from the start of the next period until he is named in the 'player1_name' coumn of a SUB event row.


    Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks Exits,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
    89,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Livers Enters,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,DET,,
        
    In event row 88, Alec Burks exits the court with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period.
    This is because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Alec Burks’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, 
    and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    player1_name is on the team DET because ‘DET’ is listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column. 

    In event row 89, Isaiah Livers enters the game with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period.
    This is because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Isaiah Livers’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, 
    and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    player2_name is on the team DET because ‘DET’ is listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column. 
    </information on SUB events>

    <information on stint times>
    A player’s stint in basketball refers to a span of time that a player spends on the court during 
    a game before being substituted out.

    A player’s total playing time in the game is equal to the sum of all of his stints. 

    A player is considered on the court from his player2_name entry time
    until his player1_name exit time.

    A player's entry time is the value in the 'pctimestring' column of the same row 
    that the player is named in the 'player2_name' column.

    A player's exit time is the value in the 'pctimestring' column of the same row 
    that the player is named in the 'player1_name' column.

    A player can enter and exit the court multiple times throughout a period.  

    When a player is named in the ‘player2_name’ column of a SUB event row (enters court) 
    as his last SUB event of a period, he plays until the end of that period.

    He also plays from the start of the next period until he is named in the ‘player1_name’ column of a 
    SUB event row (exits court). 
    </information on stint times>

Prompt 2:
    1. If a player’s last SUB event in a period is him entering the court, then he plays 
    until the end of that period, and plays from the start of the next period, until he appears 
    in the 'player1_name' column of a SUB event row.
