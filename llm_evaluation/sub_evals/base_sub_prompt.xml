<information_on_play-by-plays_in_CSV_format>
        Play-by-plays describe the events in basketball games. 
        Play-by-plays are in CSV format. 
        CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
        In CSV formatted play-by-plays, the first row contains the column names separated by commas. 
        The column names are the names of the values in the columns of a CSV row. 

        In the case of basketball game play-by-plays, the column names are as follows:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation

        The subsequent rows are called event rows.
        Event rows describe the events in the game.

        
        .1. The first column's optional value is the event number.
        Event numbers start at ‘0’ for the first event row.
        The following rows use sequentially numbered values. 

        .2. The second column is named ‘eventmsgtype’. 
        It identifies events that occur during the game.
        Eventmsgtype values are: STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, TIMEOUT, SUB, JUMPBALL, 3POINT.ASSIST, 2POINT.ASSIST, 2POINTMISS, 3POINTMISS, 
        REBOUND, 2POINT, 3POINT, FOUL, STEAL, FTMAKE, FTMISS, STEAL.TURNOVER

        .3. The third column is named ‘period’. 
        It is a number that identifies the period the event occurs. 
        Basketball games include at least 4 periods. 
        Period values range from 1 - 4 and increase as the game progresses.

        .4. The fourth column is named ‘pctimestring’.
        It contains the time remaining in the period.
        It is formatted as minutes and seconds seperated by a colon.
        Its value descends in seconds as the game progresses.
        Its value is '12:00' at the start of each period. 
        Its value is '0:00' at the end of each period. 
        
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 7 minutes and 29 seconds before the end of the period. 
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 4 minutes and 31 seconds after the start of the period. 


        .5. The fifth column is named ‘neutraldescription’.
        It contains a brief description of the event. 

        .6. The sixth column is named ‘score’.
        It contains the two teams’ scores at the time of the event. 
        The initial score value is ‘0’.
        This means neither team has scored yet. 
        Once a team scores, the score value is formatted as ‘x - y’. 
        ‘x’ is a positive integer value that represents the away team’s score.
        ‘y’ is a positive integer value that represents the home team’s score.

        .7. The seventh column is named ‘scoremargin’.
        It contains the difference between the teams’ scores. 
        The value equals 'y' minus 'x'.

        .8. The eighth column is named ‘player1_name’.
        It contains the name of the player involved in the event.

        .9. The ninth column is named ‘player1_team_abbreviation’.
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column. 

        .10. The tenth column is named ‘player2_name’.
        It contains the name of a player involved in the event. 

        .11. The eleventh column is named ‘player2_team_abbreviation’. 
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column. 

        .12. The twelfth column is named ‘player3_name’.
        It contains the name of a player involved in the event.

        .13. The thirteenth column is named ‘player3_team_abbreviation’.
        It contains the team name of the player named in the ‘player3_name’ column.

<information_on_SUB_events>
        - ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column signifies a substitution event.
        This row is a SUB event row. 

        - In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column enters the court.
        His playing time starts at the value listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column of that row. 

        - In a SUB event row, the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column exits the court.
        His playing time ends at the value listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column of that row. 

        -If a player is named in the 'player2_name' column in his last SUB event of a period, then he plays until the end of that period.
        He also continues playing from the start of the next period until he is named in the 'player1_name' column of a SUB event row.


        Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks Exits,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
        89,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Livers Enters,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,DET,,
            
        In event row 88, Alec Burks exits the court with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period.
        This is because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Alec Burks’ is named in the ‘player1_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, 
        and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 

        player1_name is on the team DET because ‘DET’ is listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column. 

        In event row 89, Isaiah Livers enters the game with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the first period.
        This is because ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column, ‘Isaiah Livers’ is named in the ‘player2_name’ column, ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column, and ‘3:31’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 

        player2_name is on the team DET because ‘DET’ is listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column.

<information_on_stint_times>
<game_time_information>
        Game_time refers to the time an event occurs in the basketball play-by-play.
        
        Game_time uses the period and pctimestring values to determine when an event occurs into a game. 
        
        Game_time values are expressed in seconds. 

        A game begins with a game_time of 0 seconds.
        Game_time increases by 1 second as each second of the game is played. 
        A game ends with a game_time of 2880 seconds.
        
        Each period begins with a game_time of ('period value' minus 1) multiplied by 720 seconds. 
        Each period ends with a game_time of period begin game_time plus 720 seconds.
</game_time_information>

    A player’s stint time refers to a span of time that a player is on the court before leaving the court. 
    A player’s total playing time in the game is equal to the sum of all of his stint times. 

    A player's entry time is the value in the 'pctimestring' column of the same row 
    that the player is named in the 'player2_name' column.

    A player's exit time is the value in the 'pctimestring' column of the same row 
    that the player is named in the 'player1_name' column.

    A player is considered on the court from his player2_name entry time
    until his player1_name exit time.

    A player can enter and exit the court multiple times throughout a period.  

    When a player is named in the ‘player2_name’ column of a SUB event row (enters court) 
    as his last SUB event of a period, he plays until the end of that period.

    He also plays from the start of the next period until he is named in the ‘player1_name’ column of a 
    SUB event row (exits court). 

<example_stint_calculation>
    Example SUB events in CSV format:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    204,SUB,2,6:02,SUB: Bogdanovic Enters,50 - 34,-16,,,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,
    252,SUB,2,1:12,SUB: Bogdanovic Exits,62 - 48,-14,Bojan Bogdanovic,DET,,,,

    Bogdanovic enters the court in the second period with 6 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the second period ends.
    This is because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘6:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    The 'pctimestring' value descends as the period progresses. 

    Bogdanovic exits the court in the second period with 1 minute and 12 seconds remaining before the period ends.
    This is because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘1:12’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column.

    Bogdanovic’s stint time is 4 minutes and 50 seconds.
    This is because 6:02 minus 1:12 is 4:50. 
    His entrance time is subtracted by his exit time.
