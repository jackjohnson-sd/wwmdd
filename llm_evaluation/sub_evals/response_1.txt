The data appears to contain play-by-play information for a basketball game. 
The columns relevant to determining the teams and players involved are:

player1_name
player1_team_abbreviation
player2_name
player2_team_abbreviation
eventmsgtype

We can find the teams by looking at the unique values in player1_team_abbreviation and confirm by looking at player2_team_abbreviation. 
We can then find the players on each team by filtering on the team and looking at the unique values in player1_name and player2_name.

To find how many times Josh Giddey entered the game, we will filter by player2_name for 'Josh Giddey' and eventmsgtype for 'SUB' and count the rows.
