Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were on the court together for 7 minutes and 29 seconds in the first period.

Q9a. 
Total overlap is therefore 0:49 seconds.

Q9b:
Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander did not have any overlapping playing time in the third period.

Q9c. 
Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander did not have any overlapping playing time in the fourth period either.

((prompted to re-check answer))

First Overlap Interval:
No overlap as Shai exits at 10:04 when Giddey enters at 10:04.

Second Overlap Interval:
Giddey is on the court from 10:04 to 0:00.
Shai re-enters at 5:33 and stays on the court until 0:00.
Overlap is from 5:33 to 0:00.

Thus, the correct overlap interval is from 5:33 to 0:00.

Let's manually calculate this interval:

5:33 = 5 × 60 + 33 = 333 seconds

5:33=5×60+33=333 seconds

So, the correct overlapping time is 5 minutes and 33 seconds.


Q9d:
Josh Giddey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were on the court simultaneously for a total of 13 minutes and 51 seconds across all periods in the game.
