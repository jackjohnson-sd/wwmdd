Q8b:
Stint 1: 12:00
Stint 2: 6:58
Stint 3: 12:00
Stint 4: 5:33

Q8c:
Total time: 36 minutes and 31 seconds


Q9a:
Let's manually track the entries and exits for both players and calculate their overlap in the second period.

Identify Entry and Exit Times for Both Players in the Second Period:
Giddey:

Entered: 12:00
Exited: 7:23
Entered: 0:49
Gilgeous-Alexander:

Entered: 5:02
Exited: 0:00
Calculate Overlap:
Both players must be on the court at the same time. We need to find common periods when both were on the court.
Detailed Steps:
Giddey Entered at 12:00 and Exited at 7:23.
Gilgeous-Alexander Entered at 5:02 and Exited at 0:00.
Calculation:
Giddey entered at 12:00, exited at 7:23.
Gilgeous-Alexander entered at 5:02, exited at 0:00.
Overlap starts: 5:02 (when Gilgeous-Alexander entered).
Overlap ends: 7:23 (when Giddey exited).

Calculation in Seconds:
Start time: 5:02 (5*60 + 2 = 302 seconds)
End time: 7:23 (7*60 + 23 = 443 seconds)
Result:
Total Overlap in the Second Period:

Overlap duration in seconds: 443 - 302 = 141 seconds
Convert to minutes and seconds: 141 seconds = 2 minutes and 21 seconds (2:21)
So, Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander were on the court simultaneously for 2 minutes and 21 seconds in the second period.



Q11:
To determine how long Josh Giddey played in the second half of the second period, we need to identify his entry and exit times and then calculate the duration he was on the court in that specific timeframe.

Key Events for Josh Giddey in the Second Period:
Entered: 12:00
Exited: 7:23
Re-entered: 0:49
Steps to Calculate Playing Time in the Second Half of the Second Period:
Identify the midpoint of the period:

The second half of the second period starts from 6:00.
Identify Giddey's entry and exit times relative to the midpoint:

He was already on the court at the midpoint since he entered at 12:00.
He exited at 7:23.
He re-entered at 0:49 and played until the end of the period (0:00).
Calculation:
Giddey played from 6:00 to 7:23 before exiting.
He re-entered at 0:49 and played until the end of the period (0:00).
Time Calculation in Seconds:
First stint in the second half:

Start time: 6:00 = (6 * 60) = 360 seconds
End time: 7:23 = (7 * 60) + 23 = 443 seconds
Duration: 443 - 360 = 83 seconds
Second stint in the second half:

Start time: 0:49 = (0 * 60) + 49 = 49 seconds
End time: 0:00 = (0 * 60) = 0 seconds
Duration: 49 - 0 = 49 seconds
Total Duration in Seconds:
Total duration: 83 + 49 = 132 seconds
Convert to Minutes:Seconds:
Total duration: 132 seconds = 2 minutes and 12 seconds (2:12)
Conclusion:
Josh Giddey played 2 minutes and 12 seconds (2:12) in the second half of the second period.
