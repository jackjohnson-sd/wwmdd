Load and Understand the Data:

Read the CSV file containing the play-by-play data.
Inspect the data to understand the structure and the relevant columns for our analysis.
Identify Entries and Exits:

Identify the rows where Josh Giddey entered the game (eventmsgtype is "SUB" and player2_name is "Josh Giddey").
Identify the rows where Josh Giddey exited the game (eventmsgtype is "SUB" and player1_name is "Josh Giddey").
Convert Time to Game Seconds:

Define a function convert_to_game_seconds(period, pctimestring) to convert period and time in the format "MM
" to total game seconds. This helps in accurately calculating the stint durations across periods.
The function calculates the total game time in seconds as follows:
Convert pctimestring to seconds: minutes * 60 + seconds
Calculate the elapsed time in the current period: 720 - (minutes * 60 + seconds)
Add the elapsed time from previous periods: (period - 1) * 720
Total game time in seconds: elapsed time in current period + elapsed time from previous periods
Pair Entries with Exits:

For each entry, find the corresponding exit:
Start from the current entry row and look for the next exit row.
If no exit is found within the same period, assume the player played until the end of the period (i.e., time "0:00").
Calculate the stint duration by subtracting the entry game seconds from the exit game seconds.
Calculate Stint Duration:

Calculate the duration in seconds between the entry and exit times.
Convert the duration back to the "MM
" format.
