    Prompt 1:  (ATTEMPT 1)
    Here is information about basketball game play by plays in CSV format and SUB events. 
    This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
    Hold off on providing any SUB counts for now.

    Here is information about team rosters:
    The player named in the ‘player1_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
    The player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
    The player named in the ‘player3_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player3_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.

    Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    ,SUB,1,4:31,SUB: Wiggins Exits,,,Andrew Wiggins,GSW,,,,
    ,SUB,1,4:31,SUB: Poole Exits,,,Jordan Poole,GSW,,,,
    ,SUB,1,4:31,SUB: DiVincenzo Enters,,,,,Donte DiVincenzo,GSW,,
    ,SUB,1,4:31,SUB: Green Exits,,,Draymond Green,GSW,,,,

    In a SUB eventmsgtype, the player named in the ‘player1_name’ column exits the game. 
    The player named in the ‘player2_name’ column enters the game. 
    The time the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    The period the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘period’ column. 

    Here is information about lineups at the start of the periods:
    Players named in SUB events with ‘1’ in the ‘period’ column and ‘12:00’ in the ‘pctimestring’ column represent the game’s starting lineup.
    Lineup changes that occur between the end of the first period and the start of the second period are represented by SUB events with ‘1’ in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:00’ in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    Lineup changes that occur between the end of the second period and the start of the third period are represented by ‘2’ in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:00’ in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    Lineup changes that occur between the end of the third period and the start of the fourth period are represented by ‘3’ in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:00’ in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 

    Here is stint information:
    A period is 12 minutes long and the value in the ‘pctimestring’ column represents the time left in the period.  
    A player’s stint in basketball refers to a continuous period of time that a player spends on the court during a game before being substituted out.

    If a player has no exit SUB event listed in the quarter that he enters, but exits the game in the next quarter, then the player plays through the end of the quarter he entered and plays at the start of the next quarter. 

    For example, these are 2 consecutive SUB events of a player: 

    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    ,SUB,1,0:50,SUB: Poole Enters,,,,,Jordan Poole,GSW,,
    ,SUB,2,5:02,SUB: Poole Exits,,,Jordan Poole,GSW,,,,

    Notice that he enters the game in the first period with 50 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:50’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 50 seconds in the first period because 0:50 minus 0:00 is 50.

    Notice that he exits the game in the second period with 5 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘5:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 6 minutes and 58 seconds in the second period because 12:00 minus 5:02 is 6:58. 

    The player’s stint is 7 minutes and 48 seconds long.  (add sum of those two 50 and 6:58 in 2 periods)




    Prompt 2:  (ATTEMPT 2) (need to better define stints and stint calculations for Claude and Gemini)

    Added:
        (in "In a SUB eventmsgtype..." section)
        - The format of the time is MM:SS (minutes:seconds) and the time represents time remaining in the period.

        (in "Here is stint information" section)
        - If a player enters the game at period 3, pctimestring 0:00 and exits at period 4, pctimestring 5:00, 
        then the player’s stint is 7 minutes long, because he enters the game at the start of the fourth period, 
        and 12:00 minus 5:00 is 7:00. 

        - If a player enters the game at period 0, pctimestring 0:00 and exits at period 1, pctimestring 0:00, 
        then the player’s stint is 12 minutes long, because he enters the game at the start of the first period 
        and exits at the end of the first period, and 12:00 minus 0:00 is 12:00.

    Here is information about basketball game play by plays in CSV format and SUB events. 
    This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
    Hold off on providing any SUB counts for now.

    Here is information about team rosters:
    The player named in the ‘player1_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
    The player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.
    The player named in the ‘player3_name’ column is on the team listed in the ‘player3_team_abbreviation’ column of the same row.

    Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks Exits,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,

    90,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Bey Exits,22 - 15,-7,Saddiq Bey,DET,,,,
    91,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Hayes Enters,22 - 15,-7,,,Killian Hayes,DET,,

    For a SUB event row in CSV format, ‘SUB’ is listed in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column. 
    The player named in the ‘player1_name’ column exits the game. 
    The player named in the ‘player2_name’ column enters the game. 
    The period the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘period’ column. 
    The time the player enters or exits the game is in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    The format of the time is MM:SS (minutes:seconds) and the time represents time remaining in the period.  
    The period begins with ‘12:00’ listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    The period ends with ‘0:00’ listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 


    Here is information about SUBS at the start and end of periods:
    In SUB event rows with ‘12:00’ listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column, the player named in ‘player2_name’ column plays from the start of the period that’s listed in the ‘period’ column.
    In SUB event rows with ‘0:00’ listed in the pctimestring’ column, the player named in ‘player1_name’ column exits at the end of the period that’s listed in the ‘period’ column, and does not re-enter the game until the player is named in a ‘player2_name’ column of a SUB event row. 


    Here is stint information:
    A player’s stint in basketball refers to a continuous period of time that a player spends on the court during a game before being substituted out.
    A player’s total playing time in the game is equal to the sum of all of his stints.

    Here is an example of calculating a player’s stint time:
    Example SUB events in CSV format:
    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    204,SUB,2,6:02,SUB: Doncic Enters,50 - 34,-16,,,Luka Doncic,DAL,,
    252,SUB,2,1:12,SUB: Doncic Exits,62 - 48,-14,Luka Doncic,DAL,,,,

    Notice that he enters the game in the second period with 6 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘6:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. 
    Notice that he exits the game in the second period with 1 minute and 12 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘1:12’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column.
    The player’s stint is 4 minutes and 50 seconds long because 6:02 minus 1:12 is 4:50.
        
    Here is another example of stint time calculations:
    If a player has no exit SUB event listed in the quarter that he enters, but exits the game in the next quarter, then the player plays through the end of the quarter he entered and plays at the start of the next quarter. 

    For example, these are 2 consecutive SUB events of a player: 

    ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    111,SUB,1,0:50,SUB: Ivey Enters,35 - 18,-17,,,Jaden Ivey,DET,,
    216,SUB,2,5:02,SUB: Ivey Exits,50 - 34,-16,Jaden Ivey,DET,,,,

    Notice that he enters the game in the first period with 50 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘1’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘0:50’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 50 seconds in the first period because 0:50 minus 0:00 is 0:50.

    Notice that he exits the game in the second period with 5 minutes and 2 seconds remaining before the period ends, because ‘2’ is listed in the ‘period’ column and ‘5:02’ is listed in the ‘pctimestring’ column. He plays for 6 minutes and 58 seconds in the second period because 12:00 minus 5:02 is 6:58. 

    The player’s stint is 7 minutes and 48 seconds long because 6:58 plus 0:50 is 7:48.
