COMMENT:
I'm continuing to prompt the LLM to provide a hypothetical game between OKC and another team, with both of those teams not appearing in the example
PbPs in CSV format.

I'm using the same 3 example games, but changing the team OKC is playing against (now NYK, sereies 7 prompt used GSW)

I'm doing this so we can have sets a data to analyze how the LLMs create a hypothetical game.

Since the 3 games are constant, we can see how the LLms deviate in their hypothetical games based on the teams prompted to play.

If we notice strong patterns in the PbP, we can judge how well the LLM performs in creating new data/PbPs, or if the LLM

The below lines describe the playersâ€™ roles in the events in the CSV-formatted play-by-play:

For example, the item in the eventmsgtype column is the type of basketball event and the player1_name 
column is the player committing the event. 

player1_team_abbreviation is the team that player1_name is a player on.

In some cases, the player2_name column is another player associated with this event. 

player2_team_abbreviation is the team that player2_name is a player on. 

For example, with the FOUL event, player1_name is the player committing the foul and player2_name is 
the player that is being fouled against by player1_name.

For example, with the STEAL.TURNOVER event, player1_name committed the turnover and player2_name is 
credited with the steal. 

For example, with the SUB event, player1_name enters the game and player2_name leaves the game. 

For example, with the REBOUND event, player1_name commits the offensive or defensive rebound and
has possession of the ball. 

For example, with the 3POINT.ASSIST event, player1_name makes the shot and player2_name is credited with the assist.

For example, with the FTMAKE event, player1_name makes the free throw. 

For example, with the 3POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block. 

For example, with the 2POINTMISS.BLOCK event, player1_name misses the shot and player3_name is credited with the block.
