""""""""""  command line args tutorial """""""""" taken from readme.md """""""""

sh w.sh args ==>  python3 main.py args
(fyi -- if don't think the sh or the .sh is needed but yet to achieve this, with limited effort)

args 

-s,-source [web,csv,db] ==> select one as source of data, web (NBA api), csv (files), or db (data base )
    if no source specifed uses source declared in .wwmdd/settngs.json

-d,-date YYYY-MM-DD [YYYY-MM-DD] ==> date or date range for 'web' sourced games, 1 entry date, 2 entries date range

-t,-team [TEAM]  ==> team i.e. [NYK, OKC, LAL, etc], select game(s) for this team (TODO support teams)

-f,-file [file or dirctory] ==> file or directory used for 'csv' source

-m,-make [plot,csv,raw,img,stint,overlap] ==> one or more things to make: 
    plot, csv - enhneced play by play, raw - unchanged play by play, stints by player, overlap by players
    img - png,jpg formatted image of plot

-p, -subplot [all,tools,stints,events,score,margin,periodscores,boxscore,legend] ==>
    one or more of things to place on plots

-j, -json [settings_file]  ==> i.e. -j oursetting.json, uses new oursettings.json file
    anthing done on the command line can be done via a modified settings.json 
    i.e no command line paramaters means use the json file

-c,-color [colors_file] ==> specify new colors for plots
    replaces .wwmdd/colors.json with this file.

examples

    sh w.sh   
    ./w.sh  to make execuutable -> do chmod 755 w.sh
    -> runs the app based on whats in the .wwmdd/setting.json and colors.json file

    sh w.sh -s web -t OKC -d 2023-01-30 -m plot csv -p stints
    -> get data from NBA site for OKC on 2023-01-30 and show and save an enhanced play by play file, and show an plot with stints only
    
    sh w.sh -s web -t OKC -d 2023-01-01  2023-01-03 -m plot csv -p stints
    -> same as above but get all games that occured between 2023-01-01 and 2023-01-30

    sh w.sh -s csv -f OKCvGSW20230130.csv -m plot
    -> display plot for this file, .wwmdd/settings.json determines whats on plot

    sh w.sh -s csv -f llm\llm_training_data -m plot -p all
    -> display plot with all features data for csv files in llm\llm_training_data directory

    sh w.sh -c test_colors.json -s csv -f OKCvGSW20230130.csv -m plot
    -> same as above with terrible colors
