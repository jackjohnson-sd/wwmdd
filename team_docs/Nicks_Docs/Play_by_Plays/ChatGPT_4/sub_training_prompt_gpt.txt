During a basketball game, different types of events occur. 

These include made shots, miss shots, fouls, rebounds, assists, turnovers, and player substitutions. 

We call these substitution events SUBS. 

In an NBA game, 5 players on each team can play at one time.

A player can only enter a game for his team, and when he enters, a player from his team must exit. 

It's important that a player not play too long for any one time. 

It's also important that a player not play too many minutes during a game. 

Coaches often substitute when a player does not seem competitive during a game. 

Coaches also make player substitutions when a player is in foul trouble.
