COMMENT:
In the prompt, I've provided average per game event statistics, an example of the desired 
CSV format, and the meaning of the CSV event and player relationships. 

I used XML tags, such as <pergamestatistics> </pergamestatistics> to seperate information 
in the prompt. 


PROMPTS:

1. Who were all the players on The Denver Nuggets in January 2022 and who were all the 
players on The Minnesota Timberwolves in January 2022?

The below lines describe the playersâ€™ roles in the events in the CSV-formatted play-by-play:
<csveventmeaning>
For example, the item in the event column is the type of basketball event and the player1 
column is the player committing the event. 

In some cases, the player2 column is another player associated with this event. 

For example, with the foul event, player2 is the player committing the foul and player1 is 
the player that is being fouled against by player2.

For example, with the steal_turnover event, player1 committed the turnover and player2 is 
credited with the steal. 

For example, with the miss_block event, player1 misses the shot and, if the shot was blocked, 
player3 is credited with the block. 

For example, with the SUBSTITUTION event, player1 enters the game and player2 leaves the game. 

For example, with the DREB_OREB event, player1 commits the offensive or defensive rebound and
has possession of the ball. 

For example, with the MADE_FG event, player1 makes the shot, and, if player1 was assisted in 
making the shot, player2 is credited with the assist.
