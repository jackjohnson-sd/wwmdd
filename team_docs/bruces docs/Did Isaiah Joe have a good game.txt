Did Isaiah Joe have a good game?

How to decide:

Compare Isaiah Joe's points/min to previous (10) games; (done)
Compare Isaiah Joe's points/min to Paul George during previous (10) games; (small)
Compare Isaiah Joe's points/min to average of 5 good bench players during previous (10) games; (medium)  
Compare Isaiah Joe's 'good things happen when in the game' score to average of 5 good bench players during previous (10) games; (large) 

note: (done, small, medium, large) refers to effort needed
process:
	isolate Isaiah Joe's pts for previous 10 games;
	isolate player or players pts to compare previous 10 games;
	if players, calculate and store average normalized pts;
	when IJ's pts/min number is greater than 2 standard deviations (+) from compare group, call it good.

tasks:
	grep box score csv files to isolate players (small)
	add Isaiah Joe and comp players to ijcomp csv file (small)
	calculate and append normalized compare value to csv file (small)
	graph and mark 'good games' (?, depending on tools)
