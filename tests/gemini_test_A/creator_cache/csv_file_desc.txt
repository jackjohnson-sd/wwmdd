</description of CSV formatted play by play>


    <SUB_event_information>

        - ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a SUB event row. 

        - In a SUB event row, if the ‘player2_name’ column player is not empty this means 
          the player is starting playing.

        - In a SUB event row, if the ‘player1_name’ column player is not empty this means 
          the player is stopping playing.
        
        - Any time a player stops playing another player from his team must start playing. 
          The only exception to this rule is at end of the game.

        - All players who are start the period SUB in at the start

        _ All players who are still in the game at the of period SUB out

    <SUB_event_example>
        Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks stops playing,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
        89,SUB,2,9:15,SUB: Livers starts,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,NYC,,
            
        In event row 88, Alec Burks (playing for DET) ends playing with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in period 1.

        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
        - the ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Alec Burks’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘3:31’
        - the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'DET'

        In event row 89, Isaiah Livers (playing for NYC) starts playing with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in period 2.
        
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
        - the ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Isaiah Livers’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '2'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘9:15’
        - the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'NYC'
    </SUB_event_example>
                                   
    <FOUL_event_information>
        - ‘FOUL’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a FOUL event row.

        - In a FOUL event row, the ‘player1_name’ column player commits the foul.
        player1_name is credited with committing the foul. 

        - In a FOUL event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is the victim of player1_name's foul.
        player2_name is not credited with committing the foul.  
    </FOUL_event_information>

    <FOUL_event_example>
        Here is an example of FOUL events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        18,FOUL,1,8:49,Lively II OFF.Foul (P1) (M.Kallio),9 - 7,-2,Dereck Lively II,DAL,Clint Capela,ATL,,
 
        In event row 18, Dereck Lively II (playing for DAL) committed the foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
                
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘FOUL’ 
        - the ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Dereck Lively II’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘8:49’
        - the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'DAL'

        player1_name is credited with the foul, which counts towards his and player1_team_abbreviation's foul counts.
                
        In event row 18, Clint Capela (playing for ATL) is the victim of player1_name's foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
            
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘FOUL’ 
        - the ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Clint Capela’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘8:49’
        - the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'ATL'

        Here is information about basketball game play-by-plays in CSV format. 
        This information should be used in determining your answers to my upcoming questions. 
        Hold off on providing any summaries and/or answers for now.
        If your first answer has issues, try another approach.
    </preamble_to_prompt>

    <play-by-plays_in_CSV_format_information>
        Play-by-plays describe the events in basketball games. 
        Play-by-plays are in CSV format. 
        CSV format, Comma Separated Values, uses commas as a delimiter between values.
        In CSV formatted play-by-plays, the first row contains the column names separated by commas. 
        The column names are the names of the values in the columns of a CSV row. 

        In the case of basketball game play-by-plays, the column names are as follows:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation

        The subsequent rows are called event rows.
        Each event row describes an event in the game.

        
        .1. The first column's optional value is the event number.
        Event numbers start at ‘0’ for the first event row.
        The following rows use sequentially numbered values. 

        .2. The second column is named ‘eventmsgtype’. 
        Its value is an event that occurs during the game.
        Eventmsgtype values are: STARTOFPERIOD, ENDOFPERIOD, TIMEOUT, SUB, JUMPBALL, 3POINT.ASSIST, 2POINT.ASSIST, 2POINTMISS,3POINTMISS, REBOUND, 2POINT, 3POINT, FOUL, STEAL, FTMAKE, FTMISS, STEAL.TURNOVER

        .3. The third column is named ‘period’. 
        Its value is a number that identifies the period the event occurs. 
        Basketball games include at least 4 periods. 
        Period values range from 1 - 4 and increase as the game progresses.

        .4. The fourth column is named ‘pctimestring’.
        Its value is the time remaining in the period when the event occurs..
        It is formatted as minutes and seconds seperated by a colon.
        Its value descends in seconds as the game progresses.
        Its value is '12:00' at the start of each period. 
        Its value is '0:00' at the end of each period. 
        
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 7 minutes and 29 seconds before the end of the period. 
        For example, an event row with a pctimestring value of 7:29 occurs at 4 minutes and 31 seconds after the start of the period. 


        .5. The fifth column is named ‘neutraldescription’.
        Its value is a brief description of the event. 

        .6. The sixth column is named ‘score’.
        Its value is the two teams’ scores at the time of the event. 
        The initial score value is ‘0 - 0’.
        ‘x’ is a number that represents the away team’s score.
        ‘y’ is a number that represents the home team’s score.

        .7. The seventh column is named ‘scoremargin’.
        Its value is the difference between the teams’ scores. 
        Its value equals 'y' minus 'x'.

        .8. The eighth column is named ‘player1_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event.

        .9. The ninth column is named ‘player1_team_abbreviation’.
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player1_name’ player. 

        .10. The tenth column is named ‘player2_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event. 

        .11. The eleventh column is named ‘player2_team_abbreviation’. 
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player2_name’ player. 

        .12. The twelfth column is named ‘player3_name’.
        Its value is the name of a player involved in the event.

        .13. The thirteenth column is named ‘player3_team_abbreviation’.
        Its value is the name of the team of the ‘player3_name’ player.

    <game_time_information>
        Game_time refers to the time an event occurs in a basketball play-by-play.
        
        Game_time uses the 'period' and 'pctimestring' values to determine when an event occurs in a game. 
        
        Game_time values are expressed in seconds. 

        A game begins with a game_time of 0 seconds.
        Game_time increases by 1 second as each second of the game is played. 
        A game ends with a game_time of 2880 seconds.
        
        Each period begins with a game_time of ('period value' minus 1) multiplied by 720 seconds. 
        Each period ends with a game_time of period begin game_time plus 720 seconds.

        This python code converts time from game_time format to period, pctimestring format:
            # Define the function pms
            def pms(_sec):  # p eriod m inute s econd
                
                q        = int(_sec / 720) + 1
                s_into_q = int(_sec % 720)
                m_into_q = s_into_q / 60
                s_into_m = int(s_into_q % 60)
                if s_into_m == 0: s_into_m = 60
                if m_into_q == 0 and s_into_m == 60:
                    m_into_q = 12
                    q -= 1
                s = f'{q},{int(12-m_into_q)}:{int(60-s_into_m):02d}'
                return s
    </game_time_information>

    <SUB_event_information>
        - ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a SUB event row. 

        - SUB_events state when a player starts of stops playing.
        - The players playing status determins if they can have other game events.

        - In a SUB event row, the ‘player2_name’ column player starts playing.
        This player starts playing at the game_time calculated using the values in the 'period' and ‘pctimestring’ columns of that row. 
        players particpate in all game eventmsgtype when they are playing
        The exeception is they cannot have a SUB_event that lists them in player1_name 
        since this would have then entering a game they are already in.

        - In a SUB event row, the ‘player1_name’ column player ends playing.
        This player ends playing at the game_time calculated using the values in the 'period' and ‘pctimestring’ columns of that row. 
        A player not playing cannot particpate in other events, with the exception of SUB_event which has them start playing. 

    </SUB_event_information>

    <SUB_event_example>
        Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks stops playing,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
        89,SUB,2,9:15,SUB: Livers starts,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,NYC,,
            
        In event row 88, Alec Burks (playing for DET) ends playing with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in period 1.

        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
        - the ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Alec Burks’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘3:31’
        - the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'DET'

        In event row 89, Isaiah Livers (playing for NYC) starts playing with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in period 2.
        
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
        - the ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Isaiah Livers’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '2'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘9:15’
        - the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'NYC'
    </SUB_event_example>
                                   
    <stint_information>
        - THIS IS MY CHANGE
        - A stint refers to the time a player is playing (substituted in the game).
        - Stint start time is the time a player starts playing.
        - Stint end time is the time a player ends playing. 
        - A stint duration is the stint end time minus the stint start time. 
        - A player can play in multiple stints per period and game. 
        - A stint is expressed as stint start, stint end, stint duration.
        - Stints end at the end of the period for players in the game at the end of a period.
        - Stints begin for players starting the period begin at the start of ther period.
    </stint_information>

    <stint_calculation_example>
        SUB events in CSV format:
        224,SUB,2,6:02,SUB: Bogdanovic starts playing,40 - 46,6,,,Bojan Bogdanovic,ATL,,

        451,SUB,2,3:04,SUB: Bogdanovic stops playing,52 - 61,9,Bojan Bogdanovic,ATL,,,,

        In event row 224, Bojan Bogdanovic starts playing. 
        This is because:
        - The ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’
        - The ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Bojan Bogdanovic’ 

        His stint start time is 1078 seconds (in game_time format).
        This is because:
        - The ‘period’ column value is ‘2’
        - The ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘6:02’
        - Period, pctimestring to game_time:
            Each period is 12 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 720 seconds long.
            The start of Period 2 is at 720 seconds.
            6:02 remaining in Period 2 means (12 minutes - 6 minutes) * 60 seconds/minute - 2 seconds = 358 seconds have elapsed in Period 2.
            Therefore, game time at the start of the stint is 720 seconds (Period 1) + 358 seconds (Period 2) = 1078 seconds.

        In event row 451, Bojan Bogdanovic ends playing. 
        This is because:
        - The ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’
        - The ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Bojan Bogdanovic’ 

        His stint end time is 2336 seconds (in game_time format).
        This is because:
        - The ‘period’ column value is ‘2’
        - The ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘3:04’
        - Period, pctimestring to game_time:
            The start of Period 2 is at 720 seconds.
            3:04 remaining in Period 2 means (12 minutes - 3 minutes) * 60 seconds/minute - 4 seconds = 536 seconds have elapsed in Period 4.
            Therefore, game time at the end of the stint is 720 seconds (Periods 1) + 536 seconds (Period 2 offset) = 1256 seconds.

        His stint duration is his stint end time minus his stint start time. 

        1256 (Stint end time) – 1078 (Stint start time) = 222 seconds 

        His stint duration is 178 seconds.
    </stint_calculation_example>

 
    <FOUL_event_information>
        - ‘FOUL’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a FOUL event row.

        - In a FOUL event row, the ‘player1_name’ column player commits the foul.
        player1_name is credited with committing the foul. 

        - In a FOUL event row, the player named in the ‘player2_name’ column is the victim of player1_name's foul.
        player2_name is not credited with committing the foul.  
    </FOUL_event_information>

    <FOUL_event_example>
        Here is an example of FOUL events in CSV format:
        ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
        18,FOUL,1,8:49,Lively II OFF.Foul (P1) (M.Kallio),9 - 7,-2,Dereck Lively II,DAL,Clint Capela,ATL,,
 
        In event row 18, Dereck Lively II (playing for DAL) committed the foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
                
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘FOUL’ 
        - the ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Dereck Lively II’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘8:49’
        - the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'DAL'

        player1_name is credited with the foul, which counts towards his and player1_team_abbreviation's foul counts.
                
        In event row 18, Clint Capela (playing for ATL) is the victim of player1_name's foul with 8 minutes and 49 seconds remaining in the first period.
            
        This is because: 
        - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘FOUL’ 
        - the ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Clint Capela’
        - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
        - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘8:49’
        - the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'ATL'
