</CSV formatted stint data>

The CSV formatted strint data above is an example of the stints for a game.

Stints tell us when each player started playing in a game and how long he played.
Every time a player starts playing and stops playing creates a stint.

The first line in the file describes the data.
Stint files have this first line as a column header: 'date,PLAYER,TEAM,PERIOD.START,CLOCK.START,PERIOD.STOP,CLOCK.STOP,PLAY.TIME,OFF,DEF,±,PTS,REB,BLK,AST,STL,TO,PF,3P.MI,3P.MA,FG.MI,FG.MA,FT.MI,FT.MA,EOQ,secs,TF,JB,VO,EJ,FD'

This files have multiple rows in them.  Each row has stint data seperated by commas.

the data in a 'date' column is the date of this game.
the data in a 'PLAYER' column is the name of the player
the data in a 'TEAM' column is the name of the team
the data in a 'PERIOD.START' and 'CLOCK.START' column is when in game the stint started
the data in a 'PERIOD.STOP' and 'CLOCK.STOP' column is when in game the stint ended
the data in a 'PLAY.TIME' column is the duration of the stint

To determine how many times a player entered a game, count the number of times the player is 
listed in the 'PLAYER' column

To determine how long a player played in a game, sum the 'PLAY.TIME' values for each stint
where the player is listed in the 'PLAYER' column

You will be provided CSV formatted play by play data for a game.

<play by play SUB event information>

        - ‘SUB’ in the ‘eventmsgtype’ column identifies this row as a SUB event row. 

        - In a SUB event row, if the ‘player2_name’ column player is not empty this means 
          the player is starting playing.

        - In a SUB event row, if the ‘player1_name’ column player is not empty this means 
          the player is stopping playing.
        
        - Any time a player stops playing another player from his team must start playing. 
          The only exception to this rule is at end of the game.

</play by play SUB event information>

<SUB_event_example>
    Here is an example of SUB events in CSV format:
 
   ,eventmsgtype,period,pctimestring,neutraldescription,score,scoremargin,player1_name,player1_team_abbreviation,player2_name,player2_team_abbreviation,player3_name,player3_team_abbreviation
    88,SUB,1,3:31,SUB: Burks stops playing,22 - 15,-7,Alec Burks,DET,,,,
    89,SUB,2,9:15,SUB: Livers starts,22 - 15,-7,,,Isaiah Livers,NYC,,
        
    In event row 88, Alec Burks (playing for DET) ends playing with 3 minutes and 31 seconds remaining in period 1.

    This is because: 
    - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
    - the ‘player1_name’ column value is ‘Alec Burks’
    - the ‘period’ column value is '1'
    - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘3:31’
    - the ‘player1_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'DET'

    In event row 89, Isaiah Livers (playing for NYC) starts playing with 9 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in period 2.
    
    This is because: 
    - the ‘eventmsgtype’ column value is ‘SUB’ 
    - the ‘player2_name’ column value is ‘Isaiah Livers’
    - the ‘period’ column value is '2'
    - the ‘pctimestring’ column value is ‘9:15’
    - the ‘player2_team_abbreviation’ column value is 'NYC'
</SUB_event_example>
  
8 full game examples of stint data in csv formatted data are provided.
these stints average between 60 and 84 stints per game. 
This is 30 to 42 stints per team per game.
Two SUB events make one stint.  This means  
These stint examples include stints for both teams.
